            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our ready acceptation of my former Labors for you, hath incouraged this second and last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor of mine this way to serve you. I have for many years been convinced of the great use and need you have of the following Discourses: But the Motives that quickned me to their Publication at this time, were especially these two.</p>
            <p>First, The hand of the Lord hath gone forth with terror against you this Winter, many of your Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:205549:3"/> are gone down to the bottom. Such a doleful account of Shipwracks from every Coast, and such sad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations as have been heard in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every Maritine Town, cannot but deeply affect every Heart with Sorrow and Compassion, and hath ingaged me in this Service for the remnant that is left.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The seasonable and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care <hi>His Majesty</hi> hath at this time manifested for the regulation and preservation of your <hi>Newland</hi> Trade, and incouragement of your honest industry therein; hath also provoked me to hasten this design, for the regulation of your lives and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, without which, all external means will signifie but little to your true prosperity.</p>
            <p>This little Manual contains the sum of your duty in the several parts of your imployments, and faithfully discovers the Temptations and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers attending you in them all. Ʋp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:205549:3"/> which consideration it is fitly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Sea-mans Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As God hath cast my lot among you, so he hath inclined my heart stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously to promote your welfare. I have been by long observation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that one principal cause of your miscarriages, is the neglect of God in your outsets. Did you pray more, you might expect to prosper better. Indeed, if that <hi>Epicurean</hi> doctrine were true, That God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not himself about the affairs of this lower World, but leaves all things to be swayed by the power of Natural causes, your neglect of prayer might be more excusable, but whilest Successes and Disappointments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his pleasure, it cannot but be the most direct course you can steer to ruine all, to forget and neglect God in your enterprises. To cure this evil, and prevent the manifold mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that follow it, the <hi>First Sermon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205549:4"/> is designed. And if the Lord shall bless it to your Conviction and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I may then comfortably apply the words of <hi>Moses</hi> to you, <hi>Deut. 33.18. Rejoyce</hi> Zebulun <hi>in thy going out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You often hear the terrible voice of God in the Storms; and are at your wits end; not knowing what course to take, nor which way to turn for safety and comfort: And yet, how soon are all those Impressions worn off? And those Mercies which (whilest new) were so affecting; after a few days become stale and common? I have therefore in the <hi>Second Sermon</hi> labored not only to direct and support you in those straights, but have also indeavored to fix the Sense of those Providences upon your Hearts, and instruct you how to make due Improvements of them, by answering the several aims and designs of them.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205549:4"/>
            <p>It hath been much upon my Heart, to what and how many Temptations to sin you are exposed in Foreign Countreys, where lawful Remedies are absent, alluring Objects present, and Temptations exceedingly strengthned upon you, by hopes of secrecy and concealment: And indeed for a Man whose Heart is not throughly seasoned with Religion, and awed by the fear of God, to converse in such places, and with such Company, and not be polluted with their sins, is upon the matter as great a Miracle, as for the three Children to come out of the Fiery Furnace without an Hair sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or the smell of Fire upon their Garments. I have therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you the best preservative from these Temptations in the <hi>Third Sermon,</hi> which the Lord make an effectual Antidote to your Souls, against the Corruptions that are in the World through Lust.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:205549:5"/>
            <p>I have frequently observed the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous influence that Success and Prosperity have had upon some of you. How the God of your Mercies hath been forgotten, and his Mercies made instruments of sin against him. How apt are Men to ascribe all to their own wisdom, care, and industry; as if God had no hand in it. The <hi>Fourth Sermon</hi> therefore leads up your thoughts to the Fountain of all your good, and drops many very seasonable and necessary Cautions upon you, to keep you humble and thankful under Prosperity.</p>
            <p>And because Men will not own God in their Success, but sacrifice to their own Net: God often teaches them the evil of it by sad Losses and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments. Yea, Disappointments sometimes follow the best of Men, and that in the most just and honest imployments, to caution the former sort, and support the latter, in such a case I recommend the <hi>Fifth Sermon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:205549:5"/> to your serious consideration, not doubting, if the Blessing of God go forth with it, but it may prove a very seasonable and useful discourse to you in that condition.</p>
            <p>And lastly, Because it is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for Sea-men to forget the many Mercies they have received in a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, when it is over, and God hath brought them to the Havens of Desire, and among their Relations. I have in the last <hi>Sermon</hi> instructed them in their duty, and labored to workin such a Sense of Mercies upon their Hearts, as may ingage them to a due and thankful acknowledgment of God in all.</p>
            <p>You see by this brief account, how honest the design is in which I have ingaged for you. But I am sensible, that the management is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, it being dispatched in haste, and when my hands were filled with other work, and my body clogged
<pb facs="tcp:205549:6"/> with many infirmities. But such as it is, I heartily devote it to the special service of your Souls, and remain</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205549:7"/> which Prayer we may note the place, posture, and matter or scope.</p>
            <p>First, The place, it was upon the <hi>Shore,</hi> the parting place near to which the Ship rode, waiting for <hi>Paul:</hi> And this was no unusual thing among them in those days.<note place="margin">Per omne lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus preces ad coelum mittunt. <hi>Tertul. de Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jun.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us, They sent their Prayers to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from every Shore, and elswhere he calls them <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes littorales. Shore-Prayers.</hi> So custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary it was for holy Men in those days, to be taken into the Ship or Boat from their knees, not from the Tavern or Ale-house.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>posture, they kneeled down.</hi> As all places, so all postures have been used in Prayer. Some have used one posture, and some another; but this is the common and ordinary posture, Knees when they can (as an ingenious Author speaks) then they must be bowed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The matter and scope of the Prayer, which though it be not express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet may with great probability be argued from the place and occasion, to be as <hi>Erasmus</hi> speaks, <hi>Pro fausta Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,</hi> for a prosperous voyage, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine protection. He knew to what, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205549:8"/> how many hazards of life they are hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exposed, that border so near unto death, as Mariners and Passengers at Sea do; and therefore would not commit himself to the Sea, till first he had so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly committed himself to God, whose voice the Winds and Seas obey. Nor was he willing to take his leave of his dear Friends, until he had poured out his heart to God with them, and for them, whose faces he might never see again in this World, and ingaged their Prayers also for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As their Affections were mutually manifested by this <hi>Sacred</hi> action, <hi>Prayer;</hi> so by <hi>Civil</hi> ones too, affectionate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and <hi>Salutations. When we had taken our leave one of another.</hi> Salutations were used among the <hi>Jews,</hi> both at their meeting and parting. This latter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in words and gestures; the usual words were, <hi>The Lord bless you,</hi> Ruth 2. 4. <hi>Peace be unto thee. Grace be with you, &amp;c.</hi> The gestures were kissing each other. These were kisses which a <hi>Cato</hi> might give, and a <hi>Vestal</hi> receive. In both these, <hi>viz.</hi> Their Prayers for, and Salutations of each other, they manifested
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205549:8"/> their Christian Affections mutually, but especially by their Prayers at parting. Hence note.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>Those that undertake Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages by Sea, had need not only to pray earnestly themselves; but also to ingage the Prayers of other Christians for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They that part praying, may hope to meet again rejoycing; and those designs which are not prefaced with Prayer, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wind up with a Blessing. There are two sorts of Prayer, <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stated</hi> Prayer is our conversing with God, either publickly, privately, or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, at the constant seasons allotted for it, in the returns of every week and day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Occasional,</hi> is the Christians address to God at any time, upon extraordinary emergencies, and calls of Providence; or, when we undertake any solemn busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness (and what more solemn then this?) and then the chief matter and scope of Prayer is to be suited to the present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, and design in hand; of this sort
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205549:9"/> is that I am here to speak. Now in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Point, I will shew</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) What those special Mercies are that Sea-man should pray for, when they are to undertake a voyage.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) What influence Prayer hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those Mercies, and how it must be qualified for that end.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) What aid and assistance the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of other Christians may contribute to the procurement of them.</p>
            <p>And then make Application of all.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We will inform the Sea-man, what those special Mercies are, he should earnestly pray for, when he undertakes a voyage.</p>
            <p>And amongst those Mercies to be earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly requested of God by him; the first and principal is, <hi>The pardon of sin.</hi> A Mercy which must make a part of every Prayer; and at this time to be earnestly sued for. Guilt is that <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Ship for whose sake storms, shipwracks, and ruine pursue it. It is said <hi>Psal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>That the stormy winds fulfil Gods word.</hi> If the word there spoken of, be the word of Gods threatning against sin, as some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, then the stormy Winds, and lofty Waves, are Gods <hi>Sergeants</hi> sent out
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205549:9"/> with commission to arrest Sinners upon the Sea, his Water-Bailiffs to execute the Threatnings of God upon them in the great Deeps. Hence those expressions of Scripture. <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.23. <hi>Be sure your sin will find you out;</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Sin lieth at the door.</hi> In both which places, the Spirit of God compares a Mans guilt to a Blood-hound, that pursues and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows upon the scent where-ever a Man goes. And indeed our sins are called <hi>debts, Matth.</hi> 6.12. Not that we ow them to God, or ought to sin against him; but <hi>metonymically,</hi> because as pecuniary debts oblige him to suffer, that hath not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to pay, and expose him to the danger of Serjeants and Bailiffs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he shall be found; so do our sins in reference to God, who hath reckoned with many thousands of Sinners upon the Sea, there arrested them by his Winds and Waves which he sent out after them, and laid their Bodies in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Sea, and their Souls in the bottom of Hell. O, that is a dismal Storm that is sent after a Man, to drive Soul and Body to destruction! With what heart or courage can that Man go down into the Deeps, and expose himself
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205549:10"/> among the raging Waves, and roaring Winds, that knows God hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie with him; and for ought h<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

Mercy!</hi> how ordinary is it for their eyes (on such occasions) to add Salt-water, where alass, there was too much before! But now to have God with you in such an hour of straits, to hear, support, and deliver you; O, you cannot estimate the worth of such a Mercy.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205549:12"/> nature, as much disposed to close with temptations, as Tinder is to catch Fire: So that unless the preventing, restraining, and mortifying Grace of God be with you, they will but touch and take. If there were no Devil to tempt you exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; yet such a corrupt heart meeting with a suitable temptation and occasion, is enough to overcome you. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lusts and inticed.</hi> Alass, you know not what hearts you have till temptations prove them; and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort can you take in the success and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of your affairs, be it never so great, if you return with Consciences polluted and wounded with sin? He that brings home a pack of fine cloaths, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the plague, hath no such great bargain of it, how cheap soever he purchased them.

            <p n="4">(4.) Pray for <hi>Divine Protection</hi> in all the dangers and hazards to which you shall be exposed. You know not how soon your life and estate shall be in jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy. This night you may sleep quietly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205549:12"/> in your Cabbin, to morrow you may be tugging at the Pump, and the next night take up your lodging upon a cold Rock.

For what is your life? It is even a vapor, that appears for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</hi> How easily can God dash all your designs, and hopeful projects in one hour! You know you are every moment as near death, as you are near the Water, which is but a remove of one or two inches. How poor a defence is the strongest Ship against the lofty Seas, and lurking Rocks! How innumerable are the accidents and contingencies in a voyage, which the most skilful Navigator cannot foresee or prevent!</p>

So that it was rightly observed by him that said, <hi>A Believer tastes more sweetness in the common Bread he eats at his own Table, than another can do in the Consecrated Bread he eats at the Lords Table.</hi> And then</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Prayer hath a sanctifying influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon all our injoyments; and therefore no wonder it makes them so sweet. What you obtain this way, you obtain with a Blessing, and that is the sweetest and best part of any injoyment. So you find, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. every Creature is sanctified by the Word of God and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. One Mercy of this kind is better, than Ten thousand promiscuously dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed in the way of common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. By these no Man knows love or hatred; but these surely come from Gods love to us, and end in the increase of our love to him. So that you see Prayer hath a manifold influence upon our Mercies. But it is not any kind of Prayer that doth thus procure, sweeten, and sanctifie our Mercies to us. Some Mens Prayers rather obstruct than farther their Mercies,<note place="margin">Si bonum petant boni, bene, ad bonum.</note> but if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205549:16"/> it be the servent Prayer of a righteous Man, directed by the Rule of the Word, to the Glory of God; we may say of such Prayer as <hi>David</hi> said of <hi>Sauls</hi> Sword, and <hi>Jonathans</hi> Bow, It never returns empty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I shall shew you what aid and assistance the Prayers of others may give to the procurement of the Mercies we desire: For you see this instance in the Text, it was the united Joynt-Prayers of the <hi>Disciples</hi> with <hi>Paul,</hi> that on this occasion was judged necessary.</p>
            <p>Now considering Prayer according to its use, and end, as a means of obtaining Mercy from the Lord; the more dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, apt, and vigorous the means are, the more <hi>surely</hi> and <hi>easily</hi> the Mercies are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained which we pray for.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205549:22"/> confidence of them that are afar off upon the Sea, Psal.</hi> 65.5. Who is there among you, that hath not either heard of, or himself been an example, and instance of the Truth? I might here insert many famous examples to confirm it, but the case is too plain to need them, and it would be too great a digression.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 2. <hi>Prayer is certainly the best relief to the distressed.</hi> We may say of it, as <hi>David</hi> said of the Sword of <hi>Goliah;</hi> give me that, for there is none like it. You that are Sea-men, know what the use of the <hi>Pump</hi> is, when the Waters leak into your Ship; and of what use the Scupper-holes are to you, when Waves break and wash over your Decks: Why, of the same use is Prayer, when sorrow leaks into your hearts, and distresses are ready to overwhelm your Souls. This gives a vent to that which else would quickly sink you. <hi>Your heart shall live th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> seek the Lord. Psal.</hi> 69.32. Prayer will buoy up your fainting spirits; it will sensibly ease an oppressed heart. No fear of fainting, while a man continues praying. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to call Prayers the Leaches of his cares and troubles. O but if troubles come in upon a man
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205549:22"/> every way, and he have no vent, no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for them; when the ordinary vents of Reason, Courage, and Resolution, are all choaked (as sometimes they are) and there is no succor or relief coming in from Heaven: What a wretched forlorn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is such a poor creature in? O therefore get acquaintance with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 3. <hi>All secondary means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance and comfort, necessarily depend upon the will and pleasure of God, and signifying nothing without him.</hi> What the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith of an Horse, I may say of a Ship. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33.17. That it is a vain thing for safety. Alass! What a poor defence <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s it against those giant-like Waves of the Sea? And that men (especially Sea-men) may be convinced of this, God hath many times caused those stately and strong built Ships to perish, and be dashed all to pieces, and preserved those that were not safe in them, upon a Plank or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken piece of the Ship, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.44. which hath carried them more safely to the shore, than it could do. And will you not yet see that means signifie nothing without God, and that your dependence <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>pon him, is necessary in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205549:23"/> and the acknowledgment thereof so too? I am perswaded there would not be half so many Shipwracks, and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments as there are, if your carnal confidence in the means were less, and your reliance upon the Lord more. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, you so often receive the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in your selves, that you may learn not to trust in your selves, but in God. O were but your Sails filled by Prayer, how prosperous would your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs be?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 4. <hi>What ever deliverances from dangers, or success in business, you receive out of the way of Prayer, can yield you but little comfort; for they are not sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to you.</hi> You may be delivered, though you pray not; and Success may follow those that seek not God for it; but that which you call Deliverance, is rather a reservation to future misery; and that you call Success, is but a snare to your Souls. You have the things, but not the comfort and blessing of them. God may give your desire to your ruine: Your lives may be rescued for a time from death, that you may fill up the measure of your iniquities. Your affairs may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper, and that prosperity may destroy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205549:23"/> you. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.32. At best it is but an effect of common Providence, and of such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances you can never say as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> said of his; and every one that receives the like Mercy in the way of Prayer, may say of his. <hi>Isai.</hi> 38.17. <hi>But thou hast in love to my soul, delivered it from the pit of corruption; for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</hi> I deny not, but a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance by the Hand of common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is a Mercy in it self; and it may prove a very great Mercy to you in the event, if time thereby added to your life be a space of Repentance; else it is but a short reprieval of your damnation, and leaves you to perish under greater guilt, then was upon you before. But on the contrary, how sweet are those Mercies, that come in the way of Prayer, that discover Gods love to you, and inflame yours to him? One such Mercy is worth a thousand of the former.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Motive</hi> 5. <hi>Consider all you that go out without Prayer, how soon you may be out of a capacity of Prayer.</hi> Now you will not, and shortly you may not, have one opportunity to pray for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more: Now unbelief shuts your Mouths, and shortly death may do it. How soon may you be past Prayers, both your own
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205549:24"/> and others; and be fixed by death in your unalterable condition? O seek the Lord therefore, whilest he may be found, call upon him whilest he is yet near. Now is your praying season; hereafter there will be no use of Prayer. <hi>For this</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist) shall every one that is godly pray unto thee, in a time when thou mayest be found: Surely in the Floods of great Waters they shall not come nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Psal.</hi> 32.6. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Saith <hi>Deodate</hi> upon the place, in the time of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral destruction of sinners, as it was in the Deluge; then there is no coming nigh to God by Prayer, nor canst thou come nigh him in the day of thy particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, by the Floods of great Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

            <p>First, The principal cause, the will and pleasure of God. He commandeth and raiseth the Stormy Wind. This is Gods Prerogative, none can raise Winds, but himself; and if <hi>Devils</hi> or <hi>Witches</hi> do it at any time; yet it is still by his permission, as you see in <hi>Job</hi> 1.12, 19. The Lord is said to hold the Wind in his Fists. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.4. As a Man holds a wild fierce Beast in a Chain, or by a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: And when they blow <hi>he brings them out of his treasuries, Psal.</hi> 135.7. There is indeed a Natural Cause of Winds, o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

It is he <hi>that commands an<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

I doubt these Mercies have been written in the Dust, which should have been ingraven, as in the Rock for ever. Thus it was with <hi>Israel,</hi> a people that saw as many wonders wrought for them by the immediate Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, as ever did any people in the World; and yet it is said of them, even after the Red Sea-deliverance, in which <hi>God divided the Sea for them, when the Waves thereof roared, Isai.</hi> 51.15. And with which, for the present, their hearts were greatly affected; for it is said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106.12. <hi>That they believed his Word, and sang his Praises.</hi> But in the next Verse you read, that a little time <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>et farther improvable for you by way
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205549:38"/> of Exhortation; serving to press you to those proper duties which God calls you to, by his terrible providential voice in the Storms, and by your wonderful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the first lesson you are to learn from hence, is, <hi>To adore the power of God.</hi> O what a manifestation of Divine Power is here! You are the men that see more than others, the Works of the Lord, and his Wonders in the Deep. It is one of Gods ends, in shewing you these Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>To make his mighty power known, Psal.</hi> 106.8. O what a terrible voyce doth God utter upon the Seas, when the Heavens are black above you, the furious Winds and dreadful Thunders ratling about you, the Sea and Waves roaring beneath you! Is not this voice of the Lord full of Majesty? Doth it not aw your hearts and make them tremble? In three things his infinite power is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to you.</p>
            <p>First, In raising these terrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, and that from so small and weak a beginning as a thin vapor from the Earth is: This is the wonderful Work of God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 135.7. <hi>He causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the Earth; he
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205549:38"/> maketh Lightnings for the Rain, he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Wind out of his Treasures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, In limiting and bounding their force and power: What prodigious effects else would follow? The Wind is a fierce and boisterous creature, and would (if God did not by his Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain) destroy, and overturn all, both by Sea and Land. Or if <hi>Satan,</hi> who is stiled <hi>The Prince of the power of the Air,</hi> were left at liberty to execute his malice by such an instrument, not a Ship should cross the Seas, nor a House be safe at Land; as is evident enough by the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous haste he made, to overturn the house with an horrible Tempest upon <hi>Jobs</hi> Chidren, as soon as he had received a permission from Heaven to do it.</p>
            <p>And 3. no less visible is the Power of God in calming, and appeasing the stormy winds, and remanding them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his treasuries, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.29. <hi>He maketh the Storm a Calme:</hi> Yea, he doth so in the very nick of time when all is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded lost. Thus you read in <hi>Mark</hi> 4.39. <hi>when the waves beat into the Ship;</hi> So that it was now full, and the Disciples cried to the Lord, <hi>Master, carest thou not that we perish? He arose and rebuked the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205549:39"/> wind, and said to the Sea, Peace, be still; and the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</hi> Just as one would hush a Child, <hi>Peace, be still.</hi> O the Soveraign Power of God! How should it be reverenced and adored by all that behold it, in these mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous effects of it?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second lesson you are taught by this Doctrine, is, <hi>To admire the Mercy of God.</hi> Mercy is no less discovered than Power, yea, the Power of God is put forth to give his Mercy a fair occasion to shine forth in your Deliverance. God sometimes permits your danger to grow to an extremity, and delays your Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the last moment, till all hopes of safety are gone, upon the like reason, That <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Resurrection was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred; that the Work of God in your Preservation may commend it self to you under the greatest advantage.</p>
            <p>O that you would view these Mercies in all their indearing circumstances. I can only hint your duty generally in this case, you may inlarge upon it, if you have hearts fit for such a blessed Work. And mark particularly the multitudes of Mercies, that are complicaated and invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in one Deliverance. Observe the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:205549:39"/> season when, the manner how, the means by which your Salvation was wrought. It is a thousand pities, that so much of Gods glory, and your comfort as anyone, even the smallest circumstance may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, should be lost.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lastly, and above all. <hi>See that you answer Gods ends in your Deliverances.</hi> If that be lost, God may say concerning you, as <hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Nabal,</hi> 1 Sam. 25.21. <hi>Surely, in vain have I kept all that this fellow hath in the Wilderness; so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was missed of all that pertained to him; and he hath requited me evil for good.</hi> So here, in vain have I kept this fellow upon the Sea, when I suffered others to sink: In vain have I preserved his life, liberty, and estate; so often by an out-stretched Arm of Power, and Mercy to him, seeing he requites me evil for good.</p>
            <p>O let me intreat you to be careful to comply with the designs and ends of God in these your wonderful Preservations. If you inquire what Gods ends in your Deliverances are. I answer,</p>
            <p>First, It is to lead you to repentance. <hi>The goodness of God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>leadeth thee to repentance. Rom.</hi> 2.4. Dost
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:205549:40"/> thou not know the Voice of Mercy? Why, it bespeaks thy return to God. It may be thou hast spent all thy life, to this day, in the service of sin: Thou never redeemedst one of all thy precious hours, to consider thine own estate, to bewail thy sin and misery, to seek after an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Christ. Why, now here is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence faln in that doth, as it were, take thee by the hand, and lead thee to this great necessary Work. The end of God in raising this Storm, was to deliver thee from the more dreadful Tempest of his Wrath; which without Repentance must shortly overtake thy Soul, in the blackness of darkness for ever. Now God hath awakened thy Conscience by this fright, made it charge home thy sins upon thee, terrified thee with dismal apprehensions of Death and Hell. O, what a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and advantage hath he now put into thy hand for Repentance, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and gaining an Interest in Jesus Christ. If this season be lost, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science suffered to fall again into a dead sleep, and thy heart be again hardned by the deceitfulness of sin, thou maist never have such an opportunity for Salvation opened to thee anymore.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:205549:40"/>
            <p>Secondly, If this end be answered, then a farther design God hath in thy Deliverance, is to ingage, and incourage thy Soul to dependance upon God, in future straits and dangers. This is food for Faith, and now you are furnished with experience of the Power, Mercy, and Goodness of God, to inable you to roll your selves upon him, when new exigencies befal you. If God exercise you with such extremities, another time you may say with the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Who delivered us from so great a Death, and doth deliver; in whom we trust he will yet deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If your first Deliverance were a Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance without a Promise, when you were without Christ; what incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have you to depend upon him, when his end is answered in your Repentance and Conversion; and being in Christ, are intituled to all the Promises?</p>
            <p>Thirdly and lastly, Gods end in your marvellous Preservations and Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, is, to furnish you for, and ingage you to a life of praise. O, how should the high praises of God, be ever in your mouths! You have seen his Works and Wonders in the Deeps. And this is it
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205549:41"/> which the <hi>Psalmist</hi> presses upon you, as a becoming Return for your Mercies, in the words following my Text. <hi>O that Men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful Works to the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O with what warm and inlarged af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, should you express your thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to the God of your Salvation! And say as <hi>David, What am I, O Lord God; and what is my Fathers house, that thou shouldst do such great things for me?</hi> Was such a life, as mine, worth the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of so many wonders to save it! O Lord, thou knowest it hath been a life spent in vanity. Thy glory hath not been precious in mine eyes, but my life hath been precious in thine eyes. Many more useful, and less sinful than my self, have perished, and I am saved. O Lord, shew me the designs and gracious ends of these Deliverances. Surely there is some great thing to be done by me, or else so great a Salvation had not been wrought for me. The Lord saw in what a sad case my poor Soul was, to be summoned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his Judgment Seat. That if I had gone down under all my guilt, I had sunk to the bottom of Hell: But
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205549:41"/> thou in love to my Soul, hast delivered it from the Pit of Corruption, that I might yet injoy a season for Salvation; and be once more intrusted with the precious Talents of Time and Means. O that I may not abuse the Grace of God in this new intrustment, as I have done in the former! Let me not live as one delivered to commit all these abominations!</p>
            <p>And now after all that is come upon me for my evils, seeing thou, my God, hast punished me less than mine iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties deserve; and hast given me such a Deliverance as this: Should I again break thy Commandments? <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>O let this new Mercy, produce a new Heart and Life!</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this <hi>Psalm</hi> the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence and Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, are the subjects of the <hi>Psalmists</hi> Meditation; and these Attributes are here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously discoursed, not only because
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205549:42"/> of the near affinity that is betwixt their Natures; but because the one is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the other: It is evident God knows all things, because he fills all places. Touching the Omniscience of God, he discovers the infinite perfection of that Attribute by the particular, and exact notice it takes of all our ways. <hi>Ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou compassest my paths, and art acquainted with all my ways:</hi> Of all our words, <hi>Ver.</hi> 4. <hi>There is not a word in my tongue, but lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether.</hi> Yea, of all our thoughts; and that not only in the instant of their conception, but long before they were conceived. <hi>Ver.</hi> 2. <hi>Thou understandest my thoughts afar off,</hi> even from eternity. Thus he displays the Omniscience of God. And then to make demonstration of the truth, and certainty of this Doctrine of Gods Omniscience, he proves it from his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence, <hi>q. d.</hi> He that fills all things, cannot but know all things. Now Gods presence fills Heaven, yea, and Hell too, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. And all parts of the Earth and Sea, even the remotest, <hi>Ver.</hi> 9, 10. And therefore no Creature, nor action of any Creature, can escape his cognisance. It is not here, as among men; if a malefactor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205549:43"/> be condemned by the Laws of one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he may escape by flying into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; but it is far otherwise here, for, saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> (personating a guilty fugitive indeavoring to make an escape from the arrest of Gods Justice) <hi>If I take the Wings of the Morning, and flee into the uttermost parts of the Sea; even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words you have these two things mainly remarkable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatest security and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a sinner supposed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That supposed security and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement utterly destroyed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The greatest security and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a sinner sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.<note place="margin">Alludit ad ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerimam radio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum solis excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, qui momento ab oriente ad oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentem perveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt. <hi>Calvin.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the Sea.</hi> Where two things seem to offer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Protection.</p>
            <p>First, The Place; the remotest part of the Sea, by which you are to understand the most obscure nook in the Creation; farthest removed from any inspection or observation.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:205549:43"/>
            <p>And secondly, His swift and speedy flight, after the commission of sin, to this supposed Refuge and Sanctuary: It is here supposed, that a sinner should flie as swift as the light of the Sun, which in a moment shines from the East to the West, and so the meaning is, Could I flee with a celerity equal to the Sun, or his Beams of Light; which breaking forth in the Morning, do in an instant inlighten the remotest part of the Hemisphere. Could I as swiftly flee to the most obscure, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, solitary place in all the World. Thus the sinners security is supposed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This supposed security and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement is utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.<note place="margin">Non accipitur deducere pro viam monstrare; Sed deducet me manus tua tanquam cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos captivum sibi commissam dedux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it. <hi>Vatab.</hi>

               <hi>Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</hi> The leading hand of God is not here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as a directing or guiding hand, to shew the fugitive sinner the the way of his escape; but contrarily, <hi>Thy hand shall lead me,</hi> as a Keeper leads his prisoner back to the place of custody, from which he indeavored an escape. And the following clause is exegetical;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205549:44"/>
               <hi>Thy right hand shall hold,</hi> or detain <hi>me. Viz.</hi> In strict custody. So that the sum of all, is this.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the whole World affords no place of secrecy or security for a sinner to escape the observing Eye, and righteous Hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jonah</hi> fled from the Lord to <hi>Tarshish;</hi> but could he escape so? No, the Lord sent a Storm after him which brought back the fugitive. <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.3, 4. We read <hi>Isai.</hi> 29.15. of such <hi>as dig deep, to hide their counsels from the Lord. (i. e.)</hi> They plot contrive and study to conceal their wicked designs, to sin with greatest se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie and security. But, what can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be a covering from him, to whose sight all things are naked and manifest? Where can a sinner be hid from him, whose presence fils Heaven and Earth? <hi>Jere.</hi> 23.24. The Scripture gives full proof to this great Truth. It is clear from <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.3. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</hi> And again, <hi>Job</hi> 34.21, 22. <hi>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings; there is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</hi> Who ever
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205549:44"/> goes about to conceal a sin in secret, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts a foolish and impossible design. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.21. <hi>Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro, through the whole Earth,</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 16.9.</p>
            <p>Now in the handling of this point, I purpose to shew you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That men are often induced to sin, upon hopes of secresie and conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That to sin upon these Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, strongly argues their natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism: They think they are safe, if men know it not; they reckon not upon Gods discovery of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That these incouragements to sin, are vain things, it being impossible any place can hide a sinner from God; and how it appears, that the Eye of God is, and must needs be upon us, and our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where-ever we are, and how close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly soever we indeavor to hide them. And then apply it,</p>
            <p>First, Men are often induced to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin upon the hopes of secresie, and concealment. Sin (especially some kinds of sin) carry so much shame and <hi>odium</hi> in them, that it restrains men from the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:205549:45"/> open practice of them; but if Satan can perswade them, they shall never be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulged to their reproach, they will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon them. See that Text, <hi>The eye of the Adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me, and disguiseth his face, Job</hi> 24.15. Reckoning himself secure, if he can carry his wickedness under a vail of darkness, not caring what wickedness he doth, so he may do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discerned. It is not the acting of sin, but the discovery of it that puts them into terrors. So it is added with respect, both to the Adulterer, and the Thief. <hi>Vers.</hi> 17. <hi>The morning is to them as the shadow of death, if one know them; they are in the terrors of the shadow of death. i. e.</hi> If a man, especially a man in Authority, a Magistrate meet them, it is as if the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of death passed before them in a vision. So those Idolaters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. <hi>Son of man, hast thou seen what the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of the house of</hi> Israel <hi>do in the dark; every man in the house of his imagery? For they say, the Lord seeth us not.</hi> They conclude all is well, if nothing appear. This incouragement of Secresie is the great argument, by which Satan prevails with men to commit any sin that hath
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:205549:45"/> shame or danger attending it. But his promises of concealment are usually made good, as his promises of great wealth are to Witches. This is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Next I will make it evident to you, that to sin upon this incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment argues Atheism of him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits it. This is plain, for did men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Omnipresence and Omniscience of God, such an incouragement to sin as secresie could have no force with them. Thus when the Antients of <hi>Israel</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Idolatry in the dark, it is plain they thought God saw them not. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.12. <hi>For they say, the Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the Earth. (i. e.)</hi> They did not really believe Gods Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence and Omniscience. And <hi>Job</hi> tells us <hi>Chap.</hi> 31.26, 27, 28. <hi>That if he had beheld the Sun in his brightness, (i. e.)</hi> To admire and worship it as a God: Or, <hi>his heart been secretly inticed; he should have denied the God that is above.</hi> Every one that is inticed to sin upon the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of Secresie, doth so far deny the God that is above. If such a man did really believe there is a God that sees him, <hi>whose eyes are as flames of fire, Revel.</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:205549:46"/> 1.14. <hi>To whom the darkness and the light are both alike. Psal.</hi> 139.12. It were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible he should be so terrified at the discovery of a Creature, and so secure and wholly unconcerned at the discovery of God: It could not be, that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the great God, should not so much trouble them, as the observation of a little child.</p>
            <p>Thus we find the inward thoughts of mens he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rts, concerning God, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r bold attempts upon secret sins. <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.15. <hi>Wo to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark; and they say, Who seeth us, and who knoweth us.</hi> They think if their works are shrowded under a vail of darkness, they are safe enough: If they can escape the Bar of an Earthly god (a Magistrate) they shall never be accountable at any other Bar. We have another sad instance of the same impiety in <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.11. <hi>And they say, How doth God know? And is there knowledge in the most high?</hi> If men did not fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y to themselves, there is no God, or (which is all one) that he is like unto themselves, one that cannot see in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; they could never incourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:205549:46"/> as they do, to sin upon such a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish pretence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, But my proper business in this place, is to prove, That these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to sin are vain things; that no sinner can hide himself from the Eye of God. This is plain both from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reason.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures speak full home to this truth. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The ways of a man are before the Lord; and he pondereth all his paths.</hi> To ponder or weigh our paths, is more than simply to observe and see them. He not only sees the action, but puts it into the ballances, with every circumstance belonging to it, and tries how much every ingredient in the action weighs, and what it comes to. So that God hath not only <hi>an universal inspection</hi> upon every action; but he hath <hi>a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal inspection</hi> into it also. <hi>The Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</hi> 1 Sam. 2.3. So <hi>Jere.</hi> 13.25, 27. <hi>Thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. I have seen thy Adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredoms and abominations. q. d.</hi> Thou forgatest there is a God in the Heavens that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held thee, and didst verily believe all was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205549:47"/> safe, because secret from man. In this fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood or cheat put upon thee, by the devil, and thine own Atheistical heart <hi>thou didst trust.</hi> But I have seen thee, and all thy secret leudness. It is a Proverb among sinners, <hi>Si non caste, tamen caute.</hi> Carry the matter, if not honestly, yet warily: If thou have a mind to sin, yet order it so, that the World may be never the wiser. But how vain a thing is this? If men do not, the Lord doth see it. <hi>I know, and am a witness, saith the Lord. Jer.</hi> 29.23. Thus the Scripture speaks roundly and fully to the point in hand.</p>
            <p>But because the Atheism of the World is so great, and it is an hard thing to convince men of this great truth, so as to over-aw them from any secret sin by it, I will by rational arguments demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the truth to every mans conscience, and give you plain and full evidence, that how secretly soever men carry their sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful designs, yet the Lord must needs be privy to them; and it is impossible they should escape his cognisance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For first, he that formed all, cannot but know all. The Workman cannot be supposed to be ignorant of any part of his own work. Now God is the Former
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:205549:47"/> of all things; every place, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he hath made. Where then shall the workers of iniquity hide themselves? You have the folly of sinners, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conceal themselves from the Eye of God, convinced and reproved by this very argument. <hi>Isai.</hi> 29.15, 16. <hi>Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them that seek deep to hide their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels from the Lord, and their words are in the dark; and they say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? Surely, your turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things upside down, shall be esteemed as the Potters clay. For shall the work say to him that made it, he made me not? Or shall the thing framed, say of him that framed it; he hath no understanding? q. d.</hi> Think ye by deep-laid designs, by the advantage of darkness, by moulding and new moulding your crafty designs in your heads, as the clay is moulded now into this, then into that shape by the Potters hands, to hide it from me? O bruitish Creatures, and without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing! Am not I the God that form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you? And can it be supposed, I should not know the most secret thoughts, plots, and designs of mine own Creatures, who cannot contrive a design, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thought without me? How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:205549:48"/> is this? Find out a place which God made not, or a Creature which he form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; and then your pretences to that Creatures concealment from God, in such a place, may have some colour. And this Argument is again urged to convince the bruitish Atheist. <hi>Psal.</hi> 94.8, 9, 10. <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand ye bruitish among the people, and ye fools, when will ye be wise? He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? He that formed the eye, shall he not see? He that chasteneth the Heathen, shall he not correct? He that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know? The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.</hi> So that it is the vainest of all vanity in the World, to think of hiding your sins from the Lord.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He that sustains all, cannot but know, and discern all. You that seek to hide counsel from the Lord, know you not, <hi>That in him you live, move, and have your being? Acts</hi> 17.28. Do not you derive that very power from him, which you abuse, to sinning against him? And do you depend necessarily, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon God for all? Must he give you the power to move, and by that power can you move beyond him, and get out
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:205549:48"/> of his reach? Cannot you think a thought without him, and yet can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him from those very thoughts which you had no power to conceive, but from him? Exercise but common Reason in the case, and it will hiss at your absurd designs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He that governs all, can be ignorant of nothing. There is a perpetual influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Providence, swaying and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Creatures, and all their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; else the very ligaments of Nature would crack, and the World break up and disband. This Providence extends it self to the least and lowest of Creatures, and their actions. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.6. A Sparrow falls not to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.<note place="margin">Deus maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis.</note> The great God hath something to do about the most minute and inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable things, yea, the most contingent and uncertain things, as is the disposal of a Lot, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. And indeed, this Omniscience of God, is that which is necessary to his Universal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. How shall he rule that person, or in that place, which he knows not? Indeed Earthly Governors may do so: It is not necessary they have a personal
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:205549:49"/> immediate cognizance of each place and person in their dominions; it is enough that they be virtually and mediately go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by them; but it is not so with God. It is necessary his eye should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately see all the parts of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He could not rule the World, if he were not an Omniscient God. <hi>Psal.</hi> 66.7. <hi>He ruleth by his power for ever, his eyes behold the Nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. He that hath set a spy to observe, and note what every man doth, cannot but know his actions, how secret soever they be. Now so it is here, God sends a spy with you to observe and record your most secret actions and thoughts, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place; I mean your own Consciences, from whose observation none of your ways can possibly be exempt. The sense of this made the Heathen say, <hi>Turpe quid ausurus, te sine teste time.</hi> When thou art attempting a sinful act, fear thy self without any other witness, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is privy to your most secret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and thoughts. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.44. <hi>Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>thy Conscience, is privy to.</hi> And if Conscience know all, God must needs
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:205549:49"/> see and know it. So the Apostle reasons, from the lesser to the greater. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our heart condemn us</hi> (which is there put for our conscience) <hi>God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> If the spirit of a man knows the things of a man, much more he that formed that spirit, and indowed man with it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He that knows things more secret and unsearchable, than our most secret actions can be, must needs know them, how secret soever they be. Now there are many things more close and secret, than any action of ours can possibly be, and yet God knows them. The thoughts of the heart are more secret, than any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action, so secret, that no Creature can search them; the Devil himself hath but a conjectural guess at them. <hi>But the Lord telleth unto man what is his thought.</hi> As in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.13. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.10. <hi>I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins. i. e.</hi> The most obscure, inward, and deep secrets lodged in the heart: Nay, which is more, he not only knows our thoughts when they are formed, and conceived in the heart, but long before their concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139.2. <hi>Thou knowest my thoughts afar off.</hi> Divines generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205549:50"/> it from eternity; even so long before they were actually thought, he foreknew every thought we would think; and what can be imagined more secret, and undiscernable, than a future thought?</p>
            <p>Now if this be known to him, how much more our thoughts formed into projects and designs, and these executed by external actions? O deceive not your selves with hopes of secresie; nothing can be a secret to him that knows the counsels of all hearts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He that providentially brings to light the most secret contrivances of men, and publishes them before all <hi>Israel,</hi> and before the Sun, must needs see them, and know them. How closely had <hi>Achan</hi> covered his wickedness? He never sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected a discovery; yet God brought i<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> to light. With how much contrivance was the sin of <hi>David</hi> covered, yet Go<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries abound with Examples of God bringing to light murders, so secretl<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> should ever be revealed in this World
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205549:50"/> without a miracle of Providence; and yet so they have been brought to light. <hi>Bessus</hi> having committed such a murther, fancied the Swallows that were chatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Chimney, had said <hi>Bessus</hi> killed a man; and thereupon confessed the fact. How secure were the contrivers of the Popish Powder-plot, that <hi>Catholick Villany,</hi> in a double sense having sworn all their accomplices to secresie, and managed the whole design so closely, that <hi>Guy Faux</hi> upon the discovery of it, said, <hi>The Devil must needs be the discoverer of it.</hi> How easie were it to expatiate upon this theam? But I will not be tiresome in instances: All ages are the witnesses of this truth. Who then can deny or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that great confessed truth. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.28. <hi>There is a God in Heaven that reveals secrets:</hi> And if he reveals them, he must needs know them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He that will judge all secrets, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know them. <hi>Now God will judge the secrets of men in that great day.</hi> Rom. 2.16. <hi>God shall bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Eccle.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> The Judge of the Whole Earth, will not judge at random, his Judgment will be
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205549:51"/> infallible, because his Omniscience is so. <hi>His eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings; for he will not lay upon man more than right, that he should enter into judgment with God. Job</hi> 34.21, 23.</p>
            <p>So that the truth of this point, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all controversie and contradiction, That the whole World affords no place of secresie or security for a sinner, to escape the observing eye, and righteous hand of God.</p>
            <p>The Uses follow in these Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Inference.</hi> If this be so, then time, place, and opportunity, how much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they seem to promise secresie and concealment, should never further a temptation to sin.</p>
            <p>Suppose all circumstances concurring, so that in the eye of Reason, you seem secured from the shameful consequences of sin; yet methinks the consideration of this truth should sufficiently deter you from a wicked purpose. <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.20. <hi>And why wilt thou, my son, he ravished with a strange woman? And imbrace the bosome of a stranger? For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his goings.</hi> There be four things
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205549:51"/> which strengthen temptations to sin; and particularly the sin of uncleanness upon Sea-men. First, The absence of lawful Remedies. Secondly, The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of alluring objects. Thirdly, The instigation of wicked examples. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, And the hopes of concealment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remote from their acquaintance: So that their sins, in probability, shall never disgrace them. This last circumstance is not the least: O how many hath it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon! But I hope you will never yield to this temptation, whose heart and strength is broken by this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eye of God upon you. A chaste Woman being once sollicited to folly, told him that sollicited her, She could never yield to the motion, till he could find a place where God should not see.</p>
            <p>Nay, my friends, it should do more than restrain you from the gross acts of of sin, it should powerfully curb the very thoughts and first motions of sin in your hearts. That was the use holy <hi>Job</hi> made of this truth. <hi>Job</hi> 31.1, 4. <hi>I have made a Covenant with mine eyes, why then should I think, upon a Maid? Doth he not see my ways, and count all my steps?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:205549:52"/>
            <p>Suppose you should carry your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so close, that none on Earth should know it; yet the Lord sees it, and will bring it into judgment; and your own Conscience is privy to it. I pray Sirs tell me, Is it not a great comfort to a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, that he acted his crime so closely, that none but the Judge, and one au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick witness more (whose testimony is as good as a thousand) beheld it? Why this is the case of all secret sinners. But to press home this great and necessary truth more particularly, I beseech you to consider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God doth not only behold you, but beholds you with detestation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in your ways of iniquity; it is a sight that grieves him to the heart. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5, 6. <hi>And the Lord saw the wickedness of man was great on the Earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart, was only evil continually.</hi> Here was wickedness, great wickedness breaking out externally, and evil, only evil, and that continually working internally. So that, both heart and life were evil exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, intensively, and protensively. This the Lord saw, and how it affected him, the sixth Verse tells you. <hi>And it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205549:52"/> repented the Lord he had made man on the Earth, and it grieved him at the heart.</hi> Ah it cuts him to the heart, to see your sinful hearts and courses. Nothing can be so contrary to the pure and holy Nature of God, as this is. This made the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet admire how his patience could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure such a sight. <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look upon iniquity; wherefore lookest thou upon, them that deal treacherously? &amp;c.</hi> As if he should say, Lord how canst thou behold thy self affronted by vile Creatures, and hold thy hands from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging it? O the stupendious patience of God!</p>
            <p n="2">2. It doth not only grieve him to the heart, but it puts his patience to the greatest tryal and exercise in beholding it. Therefore he is said, <hi>To indure with much long-suffering. Rom.</hi> 9.22. It doth, as it were, create a conflict betwixt his patience and justice. He is so provoked by your sin, that he expresses it as a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to bear it. <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. <hi>I am press<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under you, as a Cart is pressed that is full of Sheaves.</hi> Burthened till the Axle-tree of infinite Patience, be ready to crack under the weight.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:205549:53"/>
            <p>Nay thirdly, He doth not only see your evils, but he Registers and Records them, in order to a day of reckoning with you for all together, except ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34. <hi>Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my Treasures?</hi> A Metaphor taken from the <hi>Clerk of the Assize,</hi> who seals up the Bag of Inditements against the time of tryal. You think if you can bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d the eyes of men, all is well, you shall hear no more of it; Ah, but it is sealed up among Gods Treasures, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> The things he Records and reserves for the day of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p n="4">4. God doth not only see you, but he will also one day make you see your selves, and your ways, and that with horror and consternation. You think you shall taste nothing but the sweet and pleasure of sin; but how are you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? The days are coming, when sin that is now pleasant, shall be turned into Wormwood and Gall. You will not see the evil of it, and, because you see it not, you think God doth not. <hi>These things</hi> (saith God) <hi>hast thou done, and I kept si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and thou thoughtest that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together such a one as thy self; but I will
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205549:53"/> reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes. Psal.</hi> 50.21. God sees them now, and he will make you see them too, by opening your eyes in this World graciously, or in that to come judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</p>
            <p n="5">5. God doth not only see your ways, but he will make all the World see them too. For, <hi>there is nothing hid that shall not be revealed, nor covered, that shall not be made known,</hi> Matth. 10.26. <hi>There is a day when God will make manifest the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den counsels of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.5. When <hi>that which hath been spoken in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in Closets, shall be proclaimed upon the house tops, Luk.</hi> 12.3. Well then, when ever the occasions and opportunities of sin are presented to you, under this incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Secresie, I beseech you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this truth, that no place can hide you from the Eye of God. He sees all your ways, yea, he sees them with abhorrence; the sight of them is the greatest exercise of his patience: His sight of them, is not a transient glance, but he sees and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords your evils, they are sealed up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his Treasures: He sees, and will
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205549:54"/> make you see them too with horror, when he shall set them in order before you. He sees them, and will make Angels and Men see them in the great day. O then never let Secresie any more incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you to sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Inference.</hi> What prodigious Sinners must they be, that seek no covert for their sin in darkness, but with an impudent face declare, yea, glory in their shame? Who are not ashamed to sin openly with a bare face, and a Whores forehead? These are sinners of the first magnitude. <hi>They declare their sin as</hi> Sodom, <hi>and hide it not. Isai.</hi> 3.9. It is natural to man to indeavor to hide his sin as <hi>Adam;</hi> and you see from the Text, guilty sinners fain would (if it were possible) flie to any obscure corner from the observation of God and Men; and it is a Mercy, God hath planted such an affection, as shame is, in the Soul of Man, to be a Bridle to restrain his exorbitant Lusts. But yet there is a generation of monstrous sinners, who have so far unmanned themselves, <hi>That they are not at all ashamed when they commit abominations, neither can they blush. Jer.</hi> 6.15. If there be any remains of shame left in them, they exercise it
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205549:54"/> upon a wrong object: They are ashamed of that which would be their glory, and glory in that which is their shame; they add impudence to their sin, and blush not to proclaim that which others study to conceal.</p>
            <p>Such a vile temper as this, shews a man even ripe for wrath; he hath even filled up his measure, and is come to the very culminating point and top of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. There be some men arrived to such a degree of holiness, that all that converse with them, judge them even ripe for Heaven: They speak the Dialect, and have the very savor of Heaven upon them. Others are come to such a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous height of impiety, that understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men cannot but conclude they are nigh unto damnation; they speak the very language, and have the very scent of Hell upon them. Such are they that openly declare their sin as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and glory in their shame.</p>
            <p>Thus we see some Drunkards will glory in their strength, to pour down Wine and strong Drink, and can boast of the number of their Cups. Some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers can glory in their acts of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, not sufficing themselves to damn
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:205549:55"/> their own Souls, but laboring to infect and corrupt as many as they can by their filthy tongues, that they may draw them into the same misery. We can hardly tell how to screw up sin one peg higher than this. First to practise sin, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it then boast of it. Sin is first a Mans burthen, next his custom, next his delight, and then his excellency. Lord, whither is man faln! that holiness should ever be his disgrace, and sin, yea, the vilest of sins his glory! O the power of Divine Patience!</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Inference.</hi> If the Eye of God searches every obscure corner in the World, to behold the evil that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted there; then certainly the Eye of God cannot but look into every secret place in the World, to see the good that is done there. <hi>The eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil, and the good. Prov.</hi> 15.3. The good as well as the evil, yea, he beholds with delight<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the good done in secret.</p>
            <p>As some sinners seek corners to act their wickedness in, and cannot satisfie themselves to commit sin in the light (for as our Saviour saith. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20. H<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that doth evil, hateth the light) so o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:205549:55"/> the contrary, a truly godly man seeks corners to pray in, to meditate in, and to examine his own heart in, and thinks these duties of godliness can never be managed with too great a privacy; not that he is in the least ashamed of his duty, no, that is not the reason, but he is afraid of hypocrisie, when duties lie too open, and exposed to the eyes of men. A sinner takes his full liberty to vent his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when he can do it in secret; and a Saint takes his full liberty to vent and exercise his Graces, when no eye but the Eye of God sees him. Thou, when thou prayest (saith our Saviour) enter into thy Closet, and shut thy door, and pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father (which seeth in secret) shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thee openly. O how much better is it, both as to your present comfort, and future account, to get into a corner to pray; than to whore, or drink? To pour out your Souls to God graciously, than to pour out your lusts against God so wickedly? How contrary are the principles of Grace and corruption? The study of sinners is to hide their evils from the eyes of men, the study of a Saint is to hide his duties from the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205549:56"/> eyes of men: The sinner would not have the World suspect what he hath been about, nor would the Saint have all the World know what he hath been about. The way of an Adulterer is as the <hi>way of an Eagle in the Air, or as a Serpent upon a Rock. (i. e.)</hi> A secret way, where they leave no prints or tracks behind them. <hi>So is the way of an adulterous Woman, she eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. Prov.</hi> 30.19, 20. By wiping the mouth, is there meant Preventing all suspition; suffering no sign of the action to remain upon them: So contrarily, a gracious person that hath been with God in secret Prayer, or Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when his duty is ended, he labors to avoid all ostentations. And therefore you have the caution from Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>But thou, when thou fastest, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oint thy head, and wash thy face; that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret.</hi> The meaning is, carry thy private duties so close, that none may know what passeth between God and thee: When thou hast been entertained in secret with hidden <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> a Feast of fat things, wipe thy mouth in an holy sense, <hi>(i. c.)</hi> Wipe off
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:205549:56"/> suspition of hypocrisie and vanity by a prudent and humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment.<note place="margin">Non est Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio ubi omnia patent.</note> Religion doth not lay all open, as we say; as sinners have their secret pleasures, their stoln Waters which are sweet to them: So the Saints have their secret delights in God, their hidden <hi>Manna,</hi> which no man knows but he that eateth of it. And as the Eye of God vindictively beholds the one, so it delightfully beholds the other; and so you find it. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my Dove,</hi> (saith Christ to the Church) <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Inference.</hi> Doth the Eye of God see all the evil and wickedness that is committed in all the secret corners of the World, how admirable then is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of God towards the World! who can imagine, how much wickedness is secretly practised in a Town, or City
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:205549:57"/> every day? Or, if all the villanies that are perpetrated in a small circumference, in one day, were known to us, we should admire, that God doth not make us like <hi>Sodom,</hi> for judgment and desolation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next day: What then are the innumerable swarms of sin, which are as the Sand upon the Sea-shore, from all the parts and corners of the Earth! A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass, there is not the ten thousandth part of the grosser sort of wickednesses com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the World, that ever comes to our eye or ear; and if it did, we cannot estimate the evil of sin, as God doth; nor feel with that resentment, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it, as he doth; and yet the long-suffering God forbears it with infinite patience. Surely his power was not more discovered in making the World, than it is in forbearing to destroy it again, for the wiekedness that is in it. But the World stands for the Churches sake that is in it. <hi>And were it not, that the Lord of Hosts had left unto us a small remnant, we had been as</hi> Sodom, <hi>we had been like unto</hi> Gomorrah, Isai. 1.9. There is also an elect remnant to be called and gathered by the Gospel, out of it, in their several generations; and when that number
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205549:57"/> shall be accomplished, God will set fire to the Four quarters of it, and it shall lie in white Ashes; till then, the long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God waiteth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Inference.</hi> If God see all the secret wickedness that is committed in every corner of the World; how clear is it, that there is a judgment to come, and that this judgment will be exact?</p>
            <p>That there is a judgment to come is by this manifest, that there is abundance of sin committed in the World, which never comes to light here, nor never will in this World. It is true, some mens sins are open, and the judgments of God upon them are as open, but it is not so with all. The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Some mens sins are open before-hand, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before-hand to Judgment, and some mens, they follow after.</hi> Some mens sins are written as it were in their foreheads, every one fees them, but <hi>others follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> are not discovered till the day of the revelation of the secrets of all hearts; and then that which is now done in clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets shall be proclaimed as upon the house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops: though they were never put to shame for their sins in the places where they committed them, yet God will
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205549:58"/> shame them, before Men and Angels. This is the day to judge secrets. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
            <p>And, as it is certain, there will be such a judgment, so it is certain this judgment will be exact; for the Judge of all hath seen all: Whatever he charges any Man with, hath been acted before his face. <hi>Psal.</hi> 90.8. <hi>Thou settest our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</hi> Here can be no mistake, the Omniscient God will judge for what he hath seen; <hi>For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings, for he will not lay upon man more than right, that he should enter into judgment with God.</hi> The meaning is, he cannot mistake in his judgment, being Omniscient, and having seen all the ways of man; so that there can be no plea offered by any man for a reverse of his sentence.</p>
            <p>O then let us be exact and careful, as well in our secret as in our open actions; for God shall bring every work into judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Inference.</hi> Lastly, If the Eye of God be in every place upon us, and all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205549:58"/> our Actions: Then let those whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, hath sent them out of the eyes and observations of their Parents and Masters, keep the sense of Gods Eye upon their hearts, as ever they would escape sin and ruine.</p>
            <p>It is no small advantage to young un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled persons, to live under the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of pious and careful Governors; but it often falls out, that they are early Transplanted into another Soyl, sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Foreign Countreys in order to their Education or Imployment; and as often are there corrupted and debauched by the evil examples of the places where they reside, they learn another Language or drive another Trade than that their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or Masters designed them for. But if the sense of this great Truth, might accompany them where-ever they are, O what a Soveraign Antidote would it prove against those deadly Poysons of Temptations! This alone would be a sufficient Preservative. If our Children and Servants have but the awful sense of Gods Eye upon them, we may turn them loose in the wide World without fear.</p>
            <pb n="106" facs="tcp:205549:59"/>
            <p>If Providence shall direct this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to your hands, my Hearts desire and prayer for you is, That the Spirit of the Lord would imprint this great Truth upon your hearts. And I am the more moved to ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>avor your Preservation, upon the consideration of the apparent danger you are in, and the manifold dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments and mischiefs that must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably follow the corrupting of your tender years. The danger you are in is great, whether you consider</p>
            <p>First, The infecting catching nature of sin. No Plague is more infectious and insinuating than sin is. Many are the wiles, devices, stratagems, and baits, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan lays to draw you into sin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. Or</p>
            <p>Secondly, The pronity that is in your own Nature, to close with the offers and temptations that you are tried with, it is as great a wonder, if you escape, as that one that lives in a Pesthouse, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main healthy; or that dry Tinder should not catch, when thousands of sparks flie about it, and light upon it. Or</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The absence of all those means by which you have formerly been preserved from sin. You are now without
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:205549:59"/> the Ordinances of God, the Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the Admonitions, Counsels, Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and Observations of your Parents, Masters, and Friends: All which have been of great use to keep you from sin, and repress the vanities of youth. Or lastly,</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The manifold furtherances to Temptations which your Age affords, <hi>Childhood and Youth are vanity.</hi> Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderateness, rashness, injudiciousness, and the want of experience, do all cast you into the very snare. See how the Holy Ghost hath signified the danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at your age, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.7.</p>
            <p>All these things do greatly indanger you. And if any, or all of them together, prevail to the vitiating and corrupting of you, then what a train of sad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences will follow upon it! For first,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Great God will be dishonored and reproached by you, even that God whose distinguishing Mercies are now before your eyes, and should be admired by you. That caused you to spring up in a better soil, and not from Idolaters in a Land of Darkness.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:205549:60"/>2. Conscience will be wounded and polluted with guilt; and though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you feel not the remorse and gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it, yet now you are preparing for it. The sins of youth, are complaints and sorrows of old age. <hi>Job</hi> 13.26.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The hearts of your Friends (if Godly) will be grieved and greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, to find their expectations and hopes disappointed; and all those Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for you, and Counsels bestowed on you to come to nothing. If an unequal match by <hi>Esau</hi> was such a grief of heart to <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Rebecca,</hi> what will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaness and uncleanness be to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.34.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The serviceableness and comfort of your whole life, will in all probability be destroyed by the corruption of your youth. If Blossoms be withered, and Buds nipt, what Fruit can be expected? To conclude,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Your precious and immortal Souls are hazarded to all Eternity. And <hi>what shall it profit a man to gain the whole World, and lose his own soul; or, what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? Matth.</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:205549:60"/>
            <p>All this mischief may be happily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the serious consideration of this point, you have now been reading. For if God shall fix that Truth in your Hearts by Faith, then</p>
            <p>First, Instead of running with others into the same excess of riot, you will keep your selves pure and unspotted in an unclean defiling World. You will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer all temptations to sin, as <hi>Joseph,</hi> did <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>How can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sin against God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Instead of joyning with others in sin, you will mourn for the sins of others. You will say with <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 120.5. <hi>Wo is me, that I sojourn in</hi> Mesheck, <hi>that I dwell in the Tents of</hi> Kedar. Your soul, like <hi>Lots,</hi> will be vexed from day to day with the filthy conversations of the wicked. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Instead of returning to your Countrey with a wounded name and conscience, you will return full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Comfort and Peace, and to the joy of all your Friends and Relations.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To conclude, you will give fair incouragements to the expectations of all that know you, of becoming use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:205549:61"/> instruments for the glory of God, and benefit of the World in your Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. O therefore beg of God, that this Truth may be deeply ingraven upon your Hearts.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Context contains a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and very seasonable Caution to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were now passing out of their Wilderness-straits into the rich and fruitful Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which abounded with all Earthly Blessings and Comforts. Now when the Lord was about to give them possession
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:205549:62"/> of this good Land, he first gives them some wholesome Caveats to prevent the abuse of these Mercies. He knew how apt they were to forget him in a prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous estate, and ascribe all their comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruitions to their own prudence and valor; to prevent this, he reminds them of their former estate, and warns them about their future estate. He reminds them of their former condition whilest they subsisted upon his immediate care in the Wilderness. <hi>Vers.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Who led thee through the great and terrible Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, wherein were fiery Serpents, and Scorpions, and Drought, where there was no Water;</hi> here were their dangers and wants. <hi>Who brought thee forth Water out of the Rock of Flint, who fed thee in the Wilderness with Manna, which thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers knew not;</hi> here were their supplies in these straits. <hi>That he might humble thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;</hi> here was the wise and gracious design of God in all this.</p>
            <p>But wherein did God humble them by feeding them with Manna? Were they not shrewdly humbled (saith Mr. <hi>Gurnal, Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 345. an ingenious Author) to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:205549:62"/> be fed with such a dainty dish, which had God for its Cook, and was called Angels food for its delicacy? It was not the meanness of the fare, but the manner of having it, by which God intended to humble them. The food was excellent, but they had it from hand to mouth; so that God kept the Key of their Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, they stood to his immediate al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. This was an humbling way. But now the dispensation of Providence was just upon the change, they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Land <hi>where they should eat Bread without scarceness, Ver.</hi> 9. And have their comforts in a more natural stated and sensible way; and now would be the danger. Therefore</p>
            <p>He not only reminds them of their former estate, but in this Text, Cautions them about their future estate, <hi>Say not in thy heart, my power, or the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth, &amp;c.</hi> In this Caution we have these two things especially to observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The false cause of their prosperity removed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true and proper cause thereof asserted.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:205549:63"/>1. The false cause removed: <hi>Not their power, or the might of their hand.</hi> That is said to be gotten by the hand, that is gotten by our wisdom, as well as labor: Head-work and wit-work, is hand-work in the sense of this Text. It cannot be denied, but they were a great people, prudent, industrious, and had an excellent polity among them: But yet, though they had all these natural ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means of inriching themselves in that fertile soyl, God will by no means allow them to ascribe their Success and Wealth to any of these causes; for alass, what are all these without his Bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The true and proper cause asserted. <hi>It is the Lord that gives thee power to get wealth, (i. e)</hi> All thy care, labor, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, strength, signifies nothing without him; it is not your pains, but his bless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that makes your designs to prosper: And therefore in all your prosperity, still acknowledge him as the Author of all. Hence note.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the Prosperity and Success of our Affairs, is not to be ascribed to our own abilities, but to the Blessing of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our lawful indeavors.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="115" facs="tcp:205549:63"/>
            <p>We find two <hi>Proverbs</hi> in one Chapter that seem to differ in the account they give of this matter; and indeed they do but seem so. It is said in <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing riches and prosperity to humane diligence. And <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. <hi>The blessing of the Lord, it maketh rich.</hi> But these two are not really opposed to each other, but the one subordinated to the other. The diligent hand with Gods blessing upon it, makes rich; neither of them alone,<note place="margin">Faith must not stifle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry blind Faith.</note> but both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. A diligent hand cannot make rich without Gods blessing; and Gods blessing doth not ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily make rich without a diligent han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> And these two are put together in their proper places. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ʋp and be doing, and the Lord be with you.</hi> It is a vain pretence for any man to say, If the Lord be with me, I may sit still, and do nothing; and a wicked one to say, If I am up and doing, I shall prosper whether God be with me, or no. The Sluggard would fain prosper without diligence; and the Atheist hopes to prosper by his diligence alone: But Christians expect
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205549:64"/> their prosperity from Gods Blessing, in the way of honest diligence.</p>
            <p>It is a common thing for men to benum their own arms, and make them as dead and useless by leaning too much upon them: So it is in a Moral, as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way. All the prudence and pains in the World avail nothing without God. So saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 127.2. <hi>It is in vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows, for so he giveth his beloved sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Man would think he that rises be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, fares hard, works hard, sits up late, cannot but be a thriving man, and probably he would be so, if Gods blessing did second his diligence and frugality. But the <hi>Psalmist</hi> intends it of diligence in a separate sense: A diligent hand work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, and then it is all in vain, and serves only to confirm the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Early up, and never the nearer.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor without God cannot prosper; and labor against God will not only destroy it self, but the laborer to boot.</p>
            <p>Now, that this is really so, as the Doctrine states it, I shall indeavor to make it evident.</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:205549:64"/>
               <item>1. By a General Demonstration of the whole Matter.</item>
               <item>2. By a Particular Enumeration of the ordinary Causes and Means of all Success; which are all dependent things upon the Lords Blessing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>First, That Success in Business is not in the power of our Hand; but in the Hand of Providence, to dispose it as he pleases, and to whom he pleases, appears by this. <hi>That Providence sometimes blasts and frustrates the most prudent, and well-laid designs of Men; and in the mean time, succeeds and prospers more weak and improbable ones.</hi> What is more common in the observation of all ages, than this? One Man shall toil, as in the fire, for very vanity; run to and fro, plot and study all the ways in the World to get an estate, deny back and belly, and all will not do: He shall never be able to attain what he strives after, but his designs shall be still fruitless. Another hath neither an head to contrive, nor an hand to labor as the former hath; nor doth he torture his brains about it, but manages his affairs with less judgment, and spends fewer thoughts about it, and yet Success fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it. It shall be cast in upon some,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205549:65"/> who as they did not, so (considering the weak management of their business) had little rational incouragement to expect it; and flie from others, who industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pursue it in the prudent choice and diligent use of all the proper means of attaining it. And this is not only an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation grounded upon our own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, but confirmed by the wisest of Men. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.11. <hi>I returned, and saw under the Sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong; neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding; nor yet favor to men of skill, but time and chance hapneth to them all.</hi> If two men run for a prize, Reason gives the prize to the swiftest; if two Armies joyn battle, Reason gives the victory to the strongest; if two men undertake a design to get wealth, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son gives the riches to the wisest; yea, but Providence sometimes disposes it quite contrary to the verdict of Reason; and the prize is given to the slowest, the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ctory to the weakest, the estate to the more shallow capacity: So that these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents seem to fall out rather casually, than answerably to the means imployed about them: And who that observes this, can
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:205549:65"/> doubt, but it is the Hand of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and not our diligence that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the issues of these things. For why doth God so often step out of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way, and cross his hands as old <hi>Israel</hi> did, laying the right hand upon upon the younger, and the left upon the elder: I mean, Success to the weak, and disappointment to the strong, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us of this great truth which I here bring it to confirm? And because men are so apt to sacrifice to their own Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and disown Providence: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it sometimes makes the case much plainer than so. It denies riches to the Industrious that live for no other end but to get them, and casts them in upon those that seek them not at all, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are scarcely competent for business. <hi>Aristides,</hi> one of the wisest men of his age, was yet still so poor, that <hi>Plutarch</hi> said, it brought a slur upon Justice it self, as if she were not able to maintain her followers. <hi>Socrates,</hi> one of the prime <hi>Grecian</hi> Sages was so exceeding poor, that <hi>Apuleius</hi> could not but note, That <hi>Poverty</hi> was become an Inmate with <hi>Philosophy;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Paupertas est Philosophiae vernacula.</note> when in the mean time, the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205549:66"/> empty, shallow, and foolish, shall come up with it, and overtake it without any pains at all, which others prosecute in the most rational course all their life, and all to no purpose. Thus it is noted of Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth,<note place="margin">Epitom. Hist. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.</note>
               <hi>None more rich, none more foolish.</hi> And this is the ground of that Proverb. <hi>Fortuna favet fatuos; Fortune favors fools.</hi> Though the Author of that Proverb, in nicknaming Providence, shewed as little wisdom as he that is the Subject of it.</p>
            <p>By all which, this point is in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral made good; it is not Industry, but Providence, that directs and commands the Success of Business: It being much in the attaining of riches, as the Apostle saith it is, in the obtaining of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>The Gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but</hi> Israel <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness. Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31. So it is here for the vindication of the honor of Providence, which men would scarcely own, if it did not thus baffle them sometimes. They that follow the World, cannot attain it, and they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205549:66"/> it, that follow it not; that all-men may see their good is not in their own hand, and lest man who is not only a covetous Creature, and would ingross all to himself, but as proud as covetous, and so should ascribe all to himself. But this will farther appear</p>
            <p>Secondly, By a particular enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ordinary Causes and Means of all success in business, which are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent things upon an higher cause.</p>
            <p>Now, if we proceed upon a rational account, we shall find five things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the success of our affairs; and that I may speak to your capacity, I will instance in that affair of Merchandising, in which, you are imployed as the hands that execute what the heads of your Merchants contrive; and will shew you, that neither their wisdom in contriving, nor your skill and industry in managing their designs can prosper without the leave and blessing of Divine Providence. Let us therefore consider what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the raising of an estate in that way of imployment; and you will find that in a rational and ordinary way, Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess cannot be expected, unless</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:205549:67"/>1. The designs and projects be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently laid, and moulded with much consideration and foresight. An error here is like an error in the first concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is not to be rectified after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. <hi>The wisdom of the prudent</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) is to understand his way;</hi> that is, To understand and throughly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the particular design and business in which he is to ingage. Rashness and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerateness here, hath been the ruine of many thousand enterprises. And if a design be never so well laid, yet</p>
            <p n="2">2. No success in business can be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally expected, except there be an election of proper instruments to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it. The best laid design in the World, may be spoiled by an ill management. If the persons imployed, be either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable or unfaithful, what but trouble and disappointment can be expected? <hi>He that sendeth a message</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) by the hands of a fool, cutteth off the legs, and drinketh damage.</hi> It is as if a man should send him on his business that hath no legs to go, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> one that is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent for the business he is imployed about. All that a man shall reap from such a design, is damage. And if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:205549:67"/> imployed be never so capable, yet if he be not also faithful to the trust committed to him, all is lost: And such is the depth of deceit in the hearts of men, that few or none can be secured against it. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the wisest of men, and yet fatally miscarried in this matter. <hi>He seeing the young man</hi> (Jeroboam) <hi>that he was a mighty man of valor, and that he was industrious, made him Ruler over all the charge of the house of</hi> Joseph, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.28. And this was the Man that rent the Kingdom from his Son, even Ten Tribes from the House of <hi>David.</hi> And yet</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let designs be projected with the greatest prudence, and committed to the management of the fittest instruments; all is nothing as to Success, without the concurrence of health, strength, favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Winds, security from the hands of enemies, and perils of the deeps. If any of these be wanting, the design miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and all our projects fail. How often are hopeful and thriving undertakements frustrated by the failer of any one of these perquisits? <hi>Go to now ye that say, to day or to morrow, we will go unto such a City, and remain there a year, and buy
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:205549:68"/> and sell, and get gain; whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow; for what is your life? It is even a vapor that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for a little while, and then vanisheth away. Jam.</hi> 4.13, 14. How soon are the purposes of mens hearts broken off, and their thoughts perish in one day? They think to send or go to such a place, and there inrich themselves, and return prosperous; but sometimes death, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times captivity, and sometimes cross Winds dash all their hopes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Proper Seasons must be nickt, and hit, else all success and expectation of increase is lost. <hi>There is</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) a season for every thing, and a time to every purpose under the Sun. Eccles.</hi> 3.1. This being taken, gives facility and speedy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch to a business; and therefore he gives this reason, why man miscarries so frequently, and is disappointed in his enterprises, because he knows not the time. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.11. <hi>He comes</hi> (as one saith) <hi>when the Bird is flown.</hi> It is a wise and weighty Proverb with the <hi>Greeks, That there is much time in a short oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</hi> That is, a man hitting the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a business, may do more in a day, than loosing it, he may be able to do in a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205549:68"/> year. This is of a special consideration in all Humane affairs, and is the very hinge upon which Success turns: So that to come before, is to pluck Apples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ripe, and to come after it, is to seek them when they are faln and perished.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Lastly, In getting wealth, the Leaks in our Estates must be stopped; else we do but put it into a Bag with holes, as the Prophets phrase is in <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. If a man loose as much one way, as he gets an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, there can be no increase. Hence it is, that many are kept low and poor all their days: If one design prospers, yet another miscarries; or, if all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well abroad, yet there is a secret consumption of it at home, by prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, riot, luxury, or a secret curse upon it, which the Scripture calls <hi>Gods blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. Hag.</hi> 1.9. If therefore by any of these ways, our gains moulder away, we do but disquiet our selves in vain, and labor in the fire for very vanity. Thus you see what things are requisit to the advancement of an estate, upon a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential account.</p>
            <p>Now let us particularly observe, what a dependence here is upon Providence in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205549:69"/> all these things; and then it will be clear, that our Good is not in our hand, nor Success at our beck, but it is the Lord that gives us power to get wealth. For,</p>
            <p>As to the moulding and projecting of a design, we may say, both of the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Merchant and ingenious Sea-man, what the Prophet doth of the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>Isai.</hi> 28.16. <hi>It is his God that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth him to discretion, and teacheth him:</hi> There is indeed a Spirit in Man, <hi>But it is the inspiration of the Almighty that giveth understanding. Job</hi> 32.8. The Faculty is Mans, but the Light of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, whether Natural or Spiritual, is Gods: And the Natural Faculty is of it self, no more capable of directing us in our Affairs without his teaching, than the <hi>Dial</hi> is to inform us of hours with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Suns shining upon it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men are so dull in apprehending and backward in acknowledging it, but will lean to their own understandings. Thence it is, that prudent designs are so often blasted, and weaker ones succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And no less doth Providence manifest it self in directing to, and prospering the means and instruments imployed in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:205549:69"/> our business. It is of the Lord, that they prove ingenious, active and faithful Servants to us; that your Factors abroad, prove not Malefactors to you; that every design is not ruined by the negligence, ignorance, or treachery of them that manage it. If God qualifie Men to be fit instruments to serve you, and then providentially direct you to them, his hand is thankfully to be owned in both. It was no small mercy to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he had so discreet, pious, and faithful a Servant to manage even his weightiest Affairs, so prudently and prosperously for him. <hi>Laban, Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Jethro,</hi> never prospered, as when <hi>Jacob, Joseph,</hi> and <hi>Moses,</hi> had the charge of their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. <hi>Laban</hi> ingenuously acknowledged, <hi>That he had learned by experience, the Lord hath blessed him for</hi> Jacobs <hi>sake. Gen.</hi> 30.27. A Heathen you see is more ingenuous in owning the Mercy of God to him in this case, than many professed Christians are, who sacrifice all to their own Net, and burn Incense to their Drag, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Idolize the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their Prosperity, and see nothing of God in it.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:205549:70"/>
            <p>And then as to the preservation of those that go down into the Sea, to do our business in the great Waters; who can but acknowledge this to be the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Work of God? Doth not daily experience shew how often poor Sea-men are cut off in the prosecution of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs? Sometimes by sickness, sometimes by storms, and sometimes by Enemies, to whom they become a prey. If they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape all these, yet how often do they lie Wind-bound, or hindered by cross ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, till the proper Season be over, and the design lost; certainly, if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence shall so far favor any man, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all these, to command Winds fit for their purpose, restrain Enemies, preserve Life, and carry them safely and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to their Ports, it deserves a thankful acknowledgment; and those that do not acknowledge Providence, do disoblige it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Who is it that stops the Leaks in your Estates, prevents the wasting of your Substance, and secures to you what you possess? Is it not the Lord? How many fair Estates moulder away insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and come to nothing? Certainly, as there is a secret Blessing in some Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205549:70"/> so that themselves can scarce give any account how they are provided for; so there is a secret blast and consumption upon others, which brings poverty upon them like an armed man. And this is the true sense of that Scripture. <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Ye have sown much, and bring in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: Ye eat, but ye have not enough: Ye drink, but are not filled with drink: Ye cloath you, but are not warm: And he that earneth wages, earneth wages to put it into a Bag with holes;</hi> or, as in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> a <hi>Bag pierced,</hi> or, <hi>bored through;</hi> what goes in at one end, goes out at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and so all labor, and all pains is lost; nothing stays with them to do them good. So that it is an undeniable truth, That <hi>Prosperity</hi> and <hi>Success</hi> is not to be ascribed to our Abilities, but to the Blessing of God upon our lawful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Inference.</hi> And if so, how are they justly reprovable, that wholly depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on means in the neglect of Providence; that never eye God, or acknowledge him in any of their ways! This is a very great evil, and highly provoking to the Lord: It is the fruit and discovery of the Natural Atheism of the Hearts of Men.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205549:71"/> How confident are Men of Success and Prosperity, when second Causes lie fair for it, and smile upon them! And on the contrary, how dejected and heartless, when they seem to lie cross to their hopes! O how few consider and believe that great truth. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1. <hi>That the righteous, and the wise, and their works are in the hand of God.</hi> To be in the hand of God, noteth both their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his Power, and to his directive Providence. Whether your works be in your hand, or put out of your hand, they always are in Gods hand to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper or frustrate them at his pleasure.</p>
            <p>Foolish man decreeth Events, without the leave of Providence; as if he were absolute lord of his own Actions, and their Success. Indeed you may then speak of Success, when you have asked Gods leave. <hi>Job</hi> 22.28. <hi>Acquaint thy self with God, then shalt thou decree a thing, and it shall be established.</hi> But your confidence in the means, whilest God is neglected, will surely be followed▪ either with a disappointment or a curse. For what is this, but to labor without God? yea, to labor against God; for so do all they, that give the glory of God to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:205549:71"/> that set the instrumental and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, in the place of the principal efficient cause. It is just with God to deny you your comfort, in those things, wherein you rob him of his glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Inference.</hi> How vain and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able are the proud boasts of Men, in the midst of their Successes and Prosperity? If God be the sole Author of it, and it <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>own thy heart in times of Success and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:205549:72"/> Prosperity, I will offer thee, Reader, a few humbling Considerations about this Matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And the first is this, Though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence do succeed and prosper thy Earthly designs, yet this is no Argument at all of the love of God to thy Soul: Thou mayest be the object of his hatred and wrath for all this. No man knows either love or hatred by all that is before them. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1. How weak an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for Heaven must that be, which mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions now in Hell, have had in a greater measure than you have. The least dram of Grace is a better pledge of happiness, than the greatest sum of Gold and Silver that ever lay in any Mans treasury. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals distinguish not internals; you cannot so much as guess what a Mans Spiritual estate is, by the view of his Temporal. <hi>Ishmael</hi> was a great man, the head of a Princely family, but excluded from the Covenant, and all its Spiritual Blessings. <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20, 21. He that reads the 73 <hi>Psalm,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> 21. Will plainly see how wretched a case that Man is in, who hath no better evidence for the love of God, than this amounts to.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:205549:72"/>2. Be not proud of outward Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Success; for Providences are very changable in these things, yea, it daily Rings the Changes all the World over. Many a greater estate than yours, and every way as well, yea, far better secured so the eye of Reason, hath he scattered in a moment. It is the saying of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher speaking of the Estates of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants</hi> and <hi>Sea-men. Non amo foelicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem e funibus pendentem.</hi> I like not that happiness that hangs upon Ropes. I need not here cite <hi>Histories</hi> to confirm this truth: There is none of you but can abundantly confirm it your selves, if you will but recollect those instances and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which have faln within your time and remembrance. It is a poor happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that may leave a Man more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to morrow, than he that never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to what you have, can be.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pride not your selves in your Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; for as Providences are very chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so the change seems very nigh to you, when your heart is thus lifted up, especially if you be such, to whose eternal happiness God hath any special regard. To be sure, he will pull down that proud heart, and quickly order Humbling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:205549:73"/> to that end. <hi>He looketh upon every one that is proud, to abase him. Job</hi> 40.11. The heart of good <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was tickled with vain glory, and he must needs shew the King of <hi>Babylons</hi> servants all his treasures, and precious things; and at that very time came the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> to him with a sad Message from the Lord, That all these Treasures in which he had gloried must be carried to <hi>Babylon, Isai.</hi> 39. If you hope comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to injoy the good of Providence provoke it not by such vain ostentations. It is an ingenious note even of an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tu quoque fac timeas, &amp; quae tibi laeta videntur,</l>
               <l>Dum loqueris, fieri tristia posse, puta.</l>
               <bibl>

               </bibl>
            </q>
            <p>Exercise Fear in Prosperity, and think with thy self, when thy heart is most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it; that whilest the boast is in thy Lips, the scene may alter, and thy happiness be turned into Sorrow. Whilest that proud boast was in the mouth of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the voice from Heaven told him, <hi>His Kingdom was departed from him. Dan.</hi> 4.30, 31. Pride shews that
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:205549:73"/> Prosperity which feeds it, to be at its Vertical Point.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Inference.</hi> If Success in Business be from the Lord, then certainly the true way to Prosperity is to commend our Affairs to God by Prayer. He takes the true way to thrive, that ingages Gods Blessing upon his indeavors. Commit thy way unto the Lord, trust also in him, and he shall bring it to pass, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.4. It is a vile thing for any Man to grudge that time that is spent in Prayer, as so much time lost in his business. But having pressed this point before, I shall add no more here.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Inference.</hi> Doth all Success and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity depend upon and come from God? Then let it be faithfully imployed to his Glory. If it <hi>be of him, and through him,</hi> then its all the reason in the World it should <hi>be to him. Rom.</hi> 11.36. You do but give him of his own, as <hi>David</hi> speaks. All this store cometh of thine hand, and is thine own, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29.16. He never intended your Estates for the gratifying of your Lusts; but to give you a larger capacity thereby of honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the use of it. O consider, when God hath prospered your Estates
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:205549:74"/> abroad, and you return successfully home, now you have an opportunity of honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and evidencing your sense of his goodness to you, by relieving of the poor with a liberal and chearful Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; by incouraging the Gospel; and making them partakers of your good things, who labor for your Souls, and dispense better things to you, than you can return to them. I would not here be mis-interpreted, as though I pleaded my own interest, under a pretence of pleading Gods. No, God forbid, I am well satisfied with a capacity of doing any good, how little soever I receive; nor can many of you reap the fruit of my labors. But I would not leave you ignorant, or regardless of so great and plain a duty as this is. You are bound to this retribution by a plain and positive Precept. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the Word, communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> You are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do it, proportionably to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess God gives you in your Trade. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. And when you have so done, not to think it any great matter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. But the discharge of a plain and necessary duty.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:205549:74"/>5 <hi>Inference.</hi> Let not your hearts be satisfied with all the Success and Increase in the World, except your Souls thrive as well as your Bodies, and your Eternal concerns prosper as well as your Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. It was a pious wish of S. <hi>John</hi> for <hi>Gaius</hi> his Host, That he might prosper and be in health, even as his Soul prospered. 3 <hi>Epist. Joh. Vers.</hi> 2. But it were to be wished, that your Souls did but prosper, as your Bodies and Estates do. It is a poor comfort to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing Estate, and a dead or declining Soul. When a considerable Present was sent to <hi>Luther,</hi> he earnestly protested, God should not put him off with those things. O Friends, I beseech you take not up in these injoyments.</p>
            <p n="6">6 <hi>Inference.</hi> Lastly, If God be the Author of all your Success, how prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious an evil is it, to make your prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty an instrument of dishonoring him that gave it, to abuse the Estates, Providence gives you, unto rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? Do you thus requite the Lord? Is this the thanks you give him for all his care over you, and kindness to you?
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205549:75"/> You would never be able to bear that from another, which God bears from you. If God do you good, O do not return him evil for it.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hese words are the Reply made by <hi>Peter</hi> unto <hi>Christ,</hi> who in the former Verse had commanded him to <hi>lanch out into the Deep, and let down the Nets for a Draught.

               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:205549:76"/> In which Reply we note these two things.</p>

               <hi>tiring, spending labor.</hi> Here was great diligence, even to the wearying and wasting of their spirits. <hi>They toiled, and that all the night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The unsuccessfulness and fruitless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their Labors, they <hi>caught nothing.</hi> Though their design was honest, and their industry great, yet it succeeded not according to their desires and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It proved but lost labor, and pains to no purpose. Hence the Note will be.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That God sometimes frustrates and blasts the most diligent Labors of Men, in their just and lawful Callings.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:205549:76"/>
            <p>What imployment more honest or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious than that of the Husbandman, who eats his Bread in the sweat of his brows, and sustains all that spending toil and labor by an expectation of Fruit in the Season? And yet sometimes it so falls out, that after all his labors and hopes, he reaps nothing but shame and disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. <hi>Joel</hi> 1.11. <hi>Be ye ashamed, O ye Husbandmen, howl O ye Vine-dressers, for the Wheat, and for the Barly, because the harvest of the Field is perished.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The imployment of the <hi>Marriner,</hi> is as lawful as it is beneficial. What he gets is gotten with eminent hazard of life and liberty, as well as Watchings and Labors; and yet it so falls out sometimes, that they labor but for the wind, and spend their strength for very vanity: God cuts off their expectations and lives together. There is a time when they return rich and prosperous; and a time, when they either return empty, or return no more. So it was with <hi>Tyre,</hi> that renowned <hi>Mart</hi> and famous <hi>Empory;</hi> the flourishing and fall of whose Trade, you have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27.33, 34. <hi>When thy Wares went forth out of the Seas, thou filledst many people, thou didst inrich the Kings of the Earth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205549:77"/> with the multitude of thy riches, and of thy merchandise.</hi> Here was their Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Success; but will this day al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways last? Shall the Sun of their prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity never set? No, no, the change was at hand; for in the next Verse the scene alters. <hi>In the day when thou shalt be broken by the Seas, in the depths of the Waters, thy merchandise, and all thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the midst of thee shall fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if we search into the Grounds and Reasons of these Disappointments, by the hand of Providence, we shall find them reducible to a threefold Cause and Reason.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The soveraign pleasure of God so disposes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The good of the People of God, requires it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manifold sins of Men in their Callings, provokes it.</p>
            <p>First, The soveraign pleasure of God so disposes it. He is the Rector of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse, and as such will still assert his Dominion. It is his pleasure to establish this order in the World, to exalt some and depress others; to set some above, and others below: All must not be rich and great, but some must be poor and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205549:77"/> low, and to these ends Providences are suited: On some it smiles, on others it frowns. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.7. <hi>The Lord maketh poor, and maketh rich; he bringeth low, and lifteth up.</hi> And certainly there is much of the Divine Wisdom that shines forth in this ordination and disposition of persons, and their conditions. If Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence had alike prospered every Mans designs, and set them upon a Level, there had been no occasion to exercise the rich Mans Charity, or the poor Mans Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nay, without frequent Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it self would scarcely be owned in Successes, nor those Successes be half so sweet to them that receive them, as now they are. The very Beauty of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence consists much in these various and contrary effects: So that with respect to the infinite Wisdom which governs the World, it is necessary some should be crossed, and others prospered in their designs.</p>
            <p>Secondly, And if we consider the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends and designs of God towards his own people, it appears needful, that all of them, in some things, and many of them in most things (relating to their outward condition in this World) should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205549:78"/> be frustrated in their expectations and contrivements. For, if all things here should succeed according to their wish, and a constant tide of Prosperity should attend them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How soon would sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality and Earthliness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade their hearts and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?<note place="margin">Luxuriant animi rebus plerumque se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundis.</note> Much prosperity like the pouring in of much Wine intoxicates, and overcomes our weak heads and hearts. Earthly as well as Heavenly objects, have a transforming efficacy in them. There cannot but be much danger in those Earthly things that give or promise us much delight. Can a Christian keep his heart as loose from the smiling, as from the frowning World? We little think how deeply it insinuates into our affections in the day of Prosperity; but when Adversity comes, then we find it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How soon would it estrange them from their God, and interrupt their communion with him? He is certainly a very mortified and heavenly Christian, whose walk with God, suffers no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption by the multitude of Earthly affairs, especially when they are prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205549:78"/> When <hi>Israel</hi> was setled in the midst of the riches and delights of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then say they, (even to their Benefactor, the Author of all their Prosperity) <hi>We are Lords, we will come no more to thee. Jer.</hi> 2.31. Or, if it do not wholly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their communion, yet it secretly destroys and wastes the vigor, life, and sweetness of it. So that Divine Wisdom sets it necessary to cross and disappoint them in the World, to prevent the mischievous influences that Prosperity would have upon their duties. He had rather you should miss your desired com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in these things, than that he should miss that delightful fellowship with you, which he so desires.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How loath should we be to leave this, if constant Success and Prosperity should follow our affairs and designs here? We see that notwithstanding all the cares, fears, sorrows, crosses, wants, and disappointments we meet with from year to year, and from day to day; yet we are apt to hug the World in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms. As bitter as it is, we court it, admire it, and zealously prosecute it. We cling to it, and are loath to leave it, though we have little rest or comfort in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:205549:79"/> it: What would we do then, if it should answer our expectations and desires? If we grasp with pleasure, a Thorn that pierces and wounds us; what would we do, if it were a Rose that had nothing but delight and pleasure in it?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, And as Disappointments fall out as the Effects of Soveraign pleasure, and are ordered as preventive means of much mischief, which Prosperity would occasion to the People of God; so it comes as a righteous retribution and punishment of the many evils that are committed in our trading and dealings with men. It is a hard thing to have much business pass through our hands, and no iniquity cleave to them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file them. If God be provoked by our iniquities against us, wonder not, that things go cross to our desires and hopes. God may suffer some men to prosper in their wickedness, and others to miscarry in their just and righteous enterprises, but ordinarily we find, that crying sins are remarkably punished sooner or later with visible judgments. So that if others do not, yet we our selves may observe the Relation, that such a judgment bears to such a sin.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:205549:79"/>
            <p>And from among many, I will here select these following evils which have destroyed the Estates and Hopes of many.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Irreligious and Atheistical neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt of God and his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, especially in those that have been inlightned, and made profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. This was the sin which brought that blasting judgment upon the estates and labors of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> tells them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Vers.</hi> 2, 4, 6, 9. compared. <hi>They neglected the House of God. (i. e.)</hi> Were careless and regardless of his Worship, and in the mean time were wholly intent upon their own houses and interests; as he tells them in <hi>Vers.</hi> 2, 4. And what was the issue of this? Why, ruine to all their Earthly comforts and designs; so he tells them <hi>Vers.</hi> 6, 9. <hi>Ye have sowen much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye cloath you, but there is none warm: And he that earneth wages, to put it into a bag with holes. Ye looked for much, and lo, it came to little; and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why, saith the Lord of Hosts? Because of mine house
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205549:80"/> that is waste, and ye turn every man unto his own house.</hi> Here are great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Disappointments of their hopes, a curse, a blast upon all they took in hand; and the procuring cause of all this, was their eager prosecution of the World, in a careless disregard of God, and his Service.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Injustice and Fraud is a blasting sin. A little unjust gain mingled with a great estate, will consume it like a Moth. The Spirit of God hath used a very lively similitude to represent to us the mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects of this sin upon all Humane diligence and industry. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the Patridge sitteth upon Eggs and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unjust gain, how long soever men sit brooding upon it, shall after all their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and expectation, turn to no other account, than a Fowls sitting upon a Nest of addle-eggs uses to do: If she sit till she have pined away her self to death, nothing is produced.</p>
            <p>You think you consult the interest of your Families herein; but the Lord tells you, <hi>That you consult shame to your houses,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:205549:80"/> Hab.</hi> 2.10. This is not the way to <hi>Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but to <hi>Fire</hi> your Nest. A quiet Conscience is infinitely better than a full Purse. One Dish of wholesom, though courser food, is better than an hundred delicate, but poysoned dishes. If a Man have eaten the best food in the World, and afterward sips but a little poyson, he loseth not only the benefit, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that which was good, but his life or health to boot. It may be you have gotten much honesty, what pitty is it all this should be destroyed for the sake of a little gotten dishonestly. This is the reason why some Men cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Oppression is a blasting sin to Mens Estates and Imployments. It is a crying sin in the ears of the Lord, and ordinarily Intails a Visible Curse upon Mens Estates. This like a Moth will sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly fret and consume the greatest Estate. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.2, 4. <hi>Your riches are corrupted and your Garments Moth-eaten. (i. e.)</hi> The secret of God, wastes and destroys what you get. And what was the cause? he tells us, <hi>Vers.</hi> 4. <hi>Behold the hire of the laborers, that have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205549:81"/> cryeth; and the cryes of them which have reaped, are entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The oppression of poor Laborers doth more mischief to the oppressors, than it doth to them that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.<note place="margin">Manton in Loc.</note> It is noted by one upon this Scripture, that it is twice repeated in this Text, <hi>Which have reaped your fields,</hi> and then again, <hi>The cry of them which have reaped;</hi> and the reason is, because it is their life, and so an act of the greatest unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. And besides, they are disappointed of the solace of their Labors. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14, 15. <hi>He hath set his heart upon it. (i. e.)</hi> He comforts himself in the toils and labors of the day, by reckoning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> at the end of the day.</p>
            <p>I wish those that are Owners and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers of poor Sea-man may seasonably consider this evil. What a wo is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him, <hi>that useth his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors service without wages. Jer.</hi> 22.13. Or, that by crafty pretences defraud them of any part thereof, or by tiresome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays. Wear out their patience, and cast them upon manifold sufferings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences while they wait for it. God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:205549:81"/> hath not only threatned to be a swift wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against those that oppress the hireling in his wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,<note place="margin">Minus sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, qui mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus tempore solvit.</note> but hath strictly forbidden the detaining of their wages. The <hi>Jews</hi> were commanded to make payment before the Sun set. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.14, 15. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.30. Be just in all your dealings and contracts, or never expect the Righteous God should smile upon your undertakings.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Falshood and Lying is a Blasting sin to our Imployments: A sin which tends to destroy all converse, and disband all civil Societies. And though by fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood men may get some present advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; yet hear what the Holy Ghost saith of riches gotten this way. <hi>The get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of riches by a lying tongue; is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. Prov.</hi> 21.6. Some trade in lies, as much as in Wares; yea, they trade off their Wares with lies. And this proves a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful trade (as some men count gain) for the present; but in reality, it is the most unprofitable trade that any man can drive. For it is but <hi>the tossing of a vanity to and fro:</hi> A phrase importing labor in vain, it profits nothing in the end; and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:205549:82"/> as it profits nothing, so it hurts much. They seek profit <hi>intentionally,</hi> but death <hi>eventually (i. e.)</hi> it will bring destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ruine, not only upon our trades, but our Souls. The God of Truth will not long prosper the way of lying. One penny gotten by a laborious hand, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than great treasures gotten by a lying tongue. Take heed you seek not death, in seeking an estate this way. It is a sin destructive to Society; for there is no trade where there is no trust, nor no trust where there is no truth; and yet this cursed trade of Lying creeps into all trades, as if there were no living (as one speaks) without lying: But sure it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you to be <hi>loosers</hi> than <hi>lyers.</hi> He sells a dear bargain indeed, that sells his Conscience with his commodity.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) Perjury or False-swearing is a Blasting sin. That man cannot prosper that lies under the guilt thereof. It is said <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.5. <hi>That God will be a swift witness against the false swearer. (i. e.)</hi> It shall not be long before God by one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able stroke of Judgment, or another wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth against so great and horrid an evil. And again, <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.4. the curse, yea, the roll of curses <hi>shall enter into the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205549:82"/> house of the false swearer, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and the stones thereof.</hi> This is a sin that hath laid many houses waste, even great and fair without inhabitant. The ruines of many that were once flourishing and great Men, are at this day left to be the lasting Monuments of Gods righteous Judgments, and dreadful warnings to Posterity.</p>
            <p>And thus I have shewed you, what are those common evils in trade, which are the causes of those Blasts and Disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments upon it. It now remains that we apply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Inference.</hi> Doth God sometimes disappoint the most diligent labors of Men in their lawful Callings? Then this teacheth you patience and submission under your Crosses and Disappointments; for it is the Lord that orders it to be so. Events are in his hand, and it is a sin of great aggravation to fret and murmur at them, when they fall out cross to your desires and hopes. <hi>Behold, is it not of the Lord of Hosts, that the people shall labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity? Hab.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:205549:83"/>
            <p>To labor in the very fire, notes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense Labor, such as exhausts the very spirits of Men, whilest they are swelter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and toiling at at; and yet all is to no purpose, they labor but for vanity: And whence is it, that such vigorous indeavors are blasted and miscarry? Is it not of the Lord? And if it be of the Lord, Why do we fret and quarrel at his disposals? Indeed many dare not openly and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge God, but seek to cover their discontent at Providence, by a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less quarrel with the Instruments, who it may be, are chargable with nothing; but that after they have done all they could, in the use of proper means, they did not also secure the event. It is true, the Dominion of Providence doth not excuse the negligence of Instruments; and in many cases, these may be justly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, when Providence is duly honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and submitted to: But when Men groundlesly quarrel with Instruments, because they are crossed in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the quarrel is commenced against God himself; and our discontents with Men, are but a covert for our discontents with God.</p>
            <pb n="155" facs="tcp:205549:83"/>
            <p>Now this is a sore evil, a sin of great and dreadful aggravations. <hi>To be given over</hi> (saith a grave Author) <hi>to a contradicting spirit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Master <hi>Strong</hi> of the Will of God. <hi>P.</hi> 242.</note>
               <hi>to dispute against any part of the Will of God; is one of the greatest Plagues that a Man can be given up to. Who art thou that repliest against God? Rom.</hi> 11. It may be thou hast lost an estate, thy friends fail, thy hopes are faln; God hath blown upon all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that thy heart did fancy to it self. Possibly in one day, the designs, labors, and hopes of many years are destroyed: Well, be it so, yet repine not against the Lord. Consider, he is the Soveraign and only Lord, who may do whatever he pleaseth to do, without giving thee any account of his matters. Who can say to him, What dost thou? Beside, if thou be one that God delights in, even these Disappointments are to be numbred with thy best Mercies. These things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to perish, that thou mayest not perish for ever; and it should trouble thee no more, than when thy life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, by casting out the wares and goods of the Ship. It is better that these perish, than that thou shouldst perish:
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205549:84"/> But if thou be one that hast mingled sin (especially such as were beforementioned) with thy trade, and so hast pulled down misery upon thine own head, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking the Lord against thee: With what face canst thou open thy mouth to complain against him? Will you lay a train to blow up all your success, and then fret against God, when you see the issue? O how unreasonable is this!</p>
            <p>But because Disappointments fall out so frequently, and it is so hard to bring our hearts to a quiet submission to the Will of God under them. I will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss this Point, until I have offered you some proper and weighty considerations, to work your hearts into a calm, and meek submission to the Will of God; and I shall account it a great mercy, if they may prevail.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Consideration.</hi> And in the first place, if thou be one that fearest God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, That Disappointments in Earthly things, fix no mark of Gods hatred upon thee. He may love thee, and yet cross thee. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.1, 2. <hi>No man knows either love or hatred, by all the things that are before him. All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous, and to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205549:84"/> the wicked.</hi> Yea, we often find Success and Prosperity following the wicked, whilest the Rod of God is upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles of the Righteous. <hi>These are the ungodly that prosper in the World</hi> (saith the <hi>Psalmist</hi>) whilest in the mean time, <hi>he was plagued all the day long, and chast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every morning. Psal.</hi> 73.12, 14. Well then, if you have no other ground than this, you cannot infer the want of love, from the want of success. A man may be prospered in wrath, and crossed in mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Consideration.</hi> And what though your projects, hopes, and expectations of inlarging your Estates, fail; yet you may live as happily and comfortably in the condition you are, (if God give you a heart suitable to it) as if you had injoyed all that success, you so fancied and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
            <p>It is not the increase of an Estate, but the blessing of God upon a competency, that makes our condition comfortable to us. As the estate inlarges, so doth the heart. The Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> speaking of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Prince, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.6. saith, <hi>He keeps not at home, he inlarges his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire as Hell, and is as Death, and cannot
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:205549:85"/> be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all Nations, and heapeth unto him all people.</hi> And this is the nature of every Mans heart, to inlarge its desire under the greatest inlargements of Providence. Still the heart is projecting for some farther comfort and content, in some new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition; when indeed, a Man is as near it in a lower condition, as in the highest exaltation.</p>

               <note place="margin">Plutarch in Pyrrho.</note>It is storied of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> that having inlarged his Dominions by the Conquest of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> he thirsted after <hi>Italy,</hi> and demanding the advice of <hi>Cineas</hi> his great Counsellor: He asked the King, What he meant to do when he had conquered <hi>Italy?</hi> Why then said he, I mean to get <hi>Sicily,</hi> which is near, rich, and powerful.

            <p n="4">4 <hi>Consideration.</hi> Be patient under Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments; for if you meekly submit, and quietly wait upon God; he can quickly repair all that you have lost, and restore it by other Providences double to you. Have you not heard after all <hi>Jobs</hi> deprivations, and the frustrations of all his earthly hopes, and his admirable pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience under all: What a gracious end the Lord made with him? And why may not you hope for such a comfortable change of Providence towards you, if you carry it under Disappointments as he did? Certainly, sad Providences are near their change, when the heart is calmed in the Will of God, and corrected home to him.</p>
            <p n="5">5 <hi>Consideration.</hi> And why should it seem so hard, and grievous to you, for God to disappoint your hopes, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, when you cannot but know, that you have disappointed his expectations from you so often, and that in greater and better things than these?</p>
            <p>He hath looked for fruit (as it is <hi>Isai.</hi> 5.4.) for obedience, reformation, and
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:205549:87"/> renewed care of duty from you many times; he promised himself, and made account of a good return of his afflictions and mercies, and you promised him as much, and yet have failed his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And is it strange that you should fail of your hopes, who have failed God so often?</p>
            <p>O then see that you be quiet in the Will of God; fret not at the defeating of your hopes: Wreak not your discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon innocent instruments; but look to the just, holy, and good Will of God in all things. The wife is sometimes angry with the servant for what he hath done, till he tell her that it was his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters order, and then she is quiet.</p>
            <p>Is a Ship miscarried, a Voyage lost, a Relation dead, an Estate gone, a Friend carried into captivity, whose return was expected with so much comfort? Why, if it be so, it is the Lord hath done it, and be thou silent before him. Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining will not make it better; sin is no proper cure for affliction. A quiet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive spirit, is pleasing to God, and profitable for you.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Inference.</hi> Doth God sometimes disappoint the expectations of Men in
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205549:87"/> their imployments, then never set your hearts immoderately upon Earthly things, nor raise up to your selves too great expectations from these things. The stronger your expectations, the heavier Gods Disappointments will be.</p>
            <p>There is a double evil in over-reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves, and over-acting our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence about worldly things: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to disappoint us, and then makes the Disappointment much more grievous when it comes.</p>
            <p>It provokes a Disappointment, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Godly. The Lord is jealous of their affections, and will not indure that any thing should be a corrival or competitor with him for their hearts: Yea, it is so usual with God to dash, and remove whatever ingrosses too much of the heart, that a gracious Soul cannot but reckon that comfort in great danger <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>And when your inordinate hopes are crost, (as it is very probable they will be) how will your sorrows be aggravated in proportion to them! Those things that seemed to promise us most comfort, are the things that give us most sorrow. Strong affections, make strong afflictions. Our sorrows usually rise from what was our hope, and our comforts from that which was least regarded.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Inference.</hi> If it be so, then labor to make sure things eternal, lest you be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally disappointed there also. O what a sad case is that Man in, whose expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions fail from both Worlds! If your hopes from this World fail; yet you may bear it comfortably, if you fail not in your better hopes: But if this fail too, you are of all men the most miserable▪ You know by experience, how sad it is to have your hopes cut off in these smaller concerns; to go forth in expectation of a profitable voyage, and to return in a worse case than you went out: It may be you thought to get an estate, but the issue is, to lose that little you had. You
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:205549:88"/> thought to go to such a place, and there meet with a good market, and possibly, your selves may be carried as slaves to be sold in the market. These Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are very sad and cutting things; but nothing to an Eternal Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in your great concern.</p>
            <p>For a Man to hope he is in Christ, and a pardoned state, and at last find himself deceived, and that all the sins of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, heart, and practice, lie upon him. To hope for admission into Heaven, when he is turned out of this World by death, and find the door shut against him; to cry with those poor disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wretches, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Lord, Lord open to us;</hi> and receive such an unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed return from Christ, as they did, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me, I know you not.</hi> Lord, how intolerable is such a defeat of hope as this! O, who can think of it without horror!</p>
            <p>The things about which your expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are frustrated in this World, are small things; you may be happy in the want of them: But the frustration of your hopes from the World to come, is in things of infinite weight. These Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments are but for a little while;
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:205549:89"/> but this will be for ever. O therefore be provoked, even by these things to a dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and seasonable prevention of a far greater misery.</p>
            <p>Since these things cannot be secured, labor to secure those things that may. O that you were but as full of thoughts, cares, and fears for Heaven, as you are for the World! You have spent many thousand thoughts, about these things, to no purpose. All your thoughts about them, are come to nothing; but had they been spent for your Souls, to what a comfortable account would they now have turned? Friends, I beseech you, make sure for eternity, and let these crosses, and losses in the World, be the happy occasions to awaken you to a seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diligence for your everlasting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests. Then you are no loosers by your losses; nay, you will have cause to call them prosperous Disappointments, and gainful losses to you.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>Inference.</hi> Then as you would not have the works and labors of your hands blasted, beware of those sins that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to blow upon them. Think not that injustice, oppression, deceit, and perjury, shall ever profit you. God hath
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205549:89"/> cursed all the ways of sin, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prosper in them. Above all, beware of Atheism and Irreligion: God will not own them, that disown him, and slight his Worship. I doubt your propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Lords day, by drunkenness, idleness, and worldly imployments, is not the least cause of those disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and losses that have befaln you. The first day of the week, like the first fruits of the <hi>Jews</hi> Harvests, might sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the whole lump.</p>
            <p>And let none pretend, that multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of business will not allow them time and disposition for Sabbath work. If you be too busie to attend the Lords service, he can quickly give you a Writ of Ease, and make you keep more resting days from your labors, than you are willing to do. The Lord would not excuse the <hi>Israelites,</hi> no not in the busiest Seasons, the times of Earing, and Harvest, and the very building of the Tabernacle; but all must give way to the Sabbath. And I am sure, the promise of Blessing and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, is made to the conscionable obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it. <hi>Isai.</hi> 58.13, 14. <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleasure upon my holy day; and call the

This was the Blessing and Priviledge of this Tribe of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> whose Cities and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages were commodiously scituated upon the Seashore, for Merchandize and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick: As you may see <hi>Jos.</hi> 19.11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their Duty, to which these Mercies and Priviledges obliged them. <hi>They shall call the People to the Mountain, there they shall offer Sacrifices of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness.</hi> By the Mountain, we are here to understand the <hi>Temple,</hi> which <hi>Moses,</hi> by the Spirit of Prophesie, foresaw to be built upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and Mount <hi>Moriah;</hi> which two were as the Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that supported it, <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. Here was the Worship of God; the Sacrificers were here offered up to him. And hither <hi>Zebulun,</hi> in the sense of Gods Mercies to them, should call the People, <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:205549:92"/> say some, their own People, their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and Neighbors; or as others, the Strangers that were among them for Traffick. Saying as <hi>Isai.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Come, let us go up to the House of the Lord, to the Mountain of the God of Jacob.</hi> And here they shall offer <hi>the Sacrifices of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> By which we are to understand their Thanks-offerings for the Mercies they had received of the Lord. The <hi>Jews</hi> had not only Expiatory Sacrifices to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the pardon of sins committed, but Eucharistical Sacrifices, or Thanks-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to testifie the sense they had of Mercies received. These Sacrifices typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Moral Duties and when these Types were abolished, the Apostle shews, that <hi>the calves of our lips,</hi> the <hi>sacrifices of praise,</hi> are in the stead of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15.</p>
            <p>So then, the sum of all, is this, That when they returned from Sea, or had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Blessings thereof, from the Hand of God, they should repair to the place of his Worship, and there acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and praise the God of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. So that the whole Verse thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, casts it self into this Doctrinal observation.</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:205549:92"/>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That it is the special duty of Sea-men, when God returns them to their habitations in peace, thankfully to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and bless his Name, for all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations and mercies they have received of his hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are Mercies indeed, which are obtained from God by Prayer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to him again by praise. When we have received our Mercies, God expects his praises: After the <hi>Psalmist</hi> had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hazards and fears of Sea-men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stormy Ocean, and the goodness of God, in bringing them to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Haven, <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.30. he presently calls upon them for this duty, <hi>Vers.</hi> 31. <hi>O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that men would, why, how is it imaginable they should not? He hath the heart of a Beast, not of a Man, that will not. Did I say the heart of a Beast? Give me that word again. There is a kind of gratitude, even in Beasts, to their Benefactors. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Ass his Masters Crib. Isai.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p>Now the method into which I will cast the discourse, shall be</p>
            <pb n="174" facs="tcp:205549:93"/>
            <p>First, To open the nature of the duty, and to shew you what it is to praise God for his Mercies.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To give you the Grounds and Reasons of the Duty, why God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects it, and you ought to give it him. And then</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To apply it in the several Uses it is improvable unto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature of the Duty needs open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for few understand what it is. Alass, it is another manner of thing than a customary, formal, cold, <hi>God be thanked.</hi> Now, if we search into the nature of this duty, we shall find that whoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes this Angelical work, must</p>
            <p>First, Be a heedful Observer of the Mercies he receives. This is fundamental to the Duty. Where no Observations of Mercies have been made, no praises for them can be returned. God was never honored by his unobserved Mercies. When <hi>David</hi> had opened the Providences of God, to the several degrees and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Men, in its various administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and called upon them distinctly, to praise God for them. He adds in the close of all, <hi>Whoso is wise, and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve these things, even they shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:205549:93"/> the loving kindness of the Lord. Psal.</hi> 107. <hi>ult.</hi> It is Gods charge against <hi>Israel,</hi> Hosea 2.8. <hi>She did not know that I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her Silver. i. e.</hi> She did not observe and take notice of these Mercies, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from my hand; but only look at the next cause. Thus it is with many, they think not upon their own Mercies; others can observe them, but they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not; they can quickly observe what trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles befal them, but take little notice of their own Mercies. Such men can never be thankful.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The thankful man must not only <hi>observe</hi> what Mercies he hath, and from whom they come; but must parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly <hi>consider</hi> them, in their natures, degrees, seasons, and manner of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. There is much of Gods glory, and our comfort lost for want of this. <hi>The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein. Psal.</hi> 111.2. And indeed, there is no imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all the World, that yields more pleasure to a gracious Soul, than the Anatomising of Providences doth. How sweet is it to observe the mutual respects, coincidencies, and introductive occasions
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:205549:94"/> of our Mercies! Every minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance hath its weight and value here. He hath little pleasure in his meat, that swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it whole without chewing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The thankful person must duly estimate and value his Mercies. It is impossible that man can be thankful for Mercies he little esteems. <hi>Israel</hi> could not praise God for that Angels food with which he fed them, whilest they despised it in saying, There is nothing but this <hi>Manna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And surely it shews the great corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our nature, That those things which should raise the value of Mercies with us, cause us the more to slight them; yet thus it falls out. The commonness, or long continuance of Mercies with us, which should indear them the more, and every day increase our obligation to God; causes them to seem but cheap and small things. And therefore doth God so often threaten them, yea, and remove them; that their worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency may thereby be acknowledged.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The thankful person must faithfully Record his Mercies, else God cannot have his due praise for them. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:205549:94"/> his benefits, Psal.</hi> 103.2. Forgotten re-M cies bear no fruit: A bad memory in this case, makes a barren heart and life.</p>
            <p>I confess, the Mercies of God are such a multitude, that a memory of Brass can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not retain them. <hi>I will come before thee in the multitude of thy mercies,</hi> saith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Psal.</hi> 5.7. They are called <hi>Showers of Blessings, Ezek.</hi> 34.26. And as impossible it is distinctly to recount all our Mercies, as to number the drops of rain that fall in a shower. Nevertheless, it hath been the pious care and indeavor of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, to preserve and perpetuate his Mercies, by using all the helps to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory they could. Therefore they have kept Registers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.14. Indited <hi>Psalms. To bring to remembrance, Psal.</hi> 70. <hi>Title.</hi> Denominated places from the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received there. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> called the place where he found so much mercy, <hi>Bethel. Hagar</hi> named the Well, where God, unexpectedly, relieved her, <hi>Beerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hairoi.</hi> The Well of him that liveth and looketh upon me, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16.13, 14.</p>
            <p>They have stamped the Mercies upon the days, in which they received them. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> called those days, in which God wrought their deliverance, <hi>Purim,</hi>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:205549:95"/> after the name <hi>Pur.</hi> Signifying the Lot <hi>Haman</hi> had cast for their lives. <hi>Esth.</hi> 9.26. Yea, they have called their Mercies upon their Children. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20. Thus thankful Souls have striven to recognize their Mercies, that God might not lose the praise, nor themselves the comfort of them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The thankful Person must be suitably affected with the Mercies he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives. It is not a <hi>speculative,</hi> but an <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate</hi> remembrance that becomes us: Then God hath his glory, when the sense of his Mercies melts our hearts into holy joy, love, and admiration. Thus <hi>David</hi> sits down before the Lord like a man astonished at his goodness to him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.20. <hi>And what can</hi> David <hi>say more? For thou Lord knowest thy servant.</hi> The Mercies of God have made the Saints hearts leap for joy within them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.4. <hi>Thou Lord hast made me glad, through thy Works; therefore will I triumph in the Works of thy hands.</hi> Mercies are not Mercies, Deliverances are no Deliverances to us, if we that receive them, are not glad of them.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The thankful Person must order his conversation suitably to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205549:95"/> that his mercies have put him under. When we have said all, it is the life of the thankful, that is the very life of thankfulness. Obedience and service are the only real manifestations of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. <hi>He that offereth praise, glorifieth me, and to him that ordereth his conversation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, will I shew the salvation of God. Psal.</hi> 50.23. Set down this for an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting truth, That God was never prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and honored by an abused Mercy. God took it ill from <hi>Hezekiah, That he rendred not again according to the benefit done unto him.</hi> 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32.25. He that is truly thankful, will say as <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 116.12. <hi>What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits?</hi> We then glorifie God with his Mercies, when we imploy them to right ends, when we thankfully take out our own share of comfort from them, receiving them with thanksgiving, as from the hand of a Father. Mr. <hi>Swinock</hi> tels of a young man,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Swinocks</hi> Christian Mans Calling, <hi>pag. 409.</hi>
               </note> who lying upon his sick bed, was always calling for meat; but assoon as it was brought him, he shook and trembled dreadfully at the fight of it, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till it was taken away; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:205549:96"/> his death, acknowledged Gods Justice; for that in his health, he ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily received his Meat without thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</p>
            <p>Use all Gods Mercies with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, God will remember them in fury, who forget him in his favors.</p>
            <p>And think not what God bestows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, is wholly for your own use: But honor God with your Mercies, by cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the naked, and feeding the hungry, especially such as are Godly. This is a due improvement of your Estates; thus you may make to your selves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness. Ah, how little do we consider, what praise, what glory, we may occasion this way from others to the Name of God!<note place="margin">Justin. Lib. <hi>51.</hi>
               </note> It is storied of <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> the <hi>Syracusian Tyrant;</hi> that when he saw what heaps of Gold and Silver his son hoarded up in his Closet. He asked him, what he meant to let it lie there, and not to make friends with it, to get the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom after his death? O Son (said he) thou hast not a spirit capable of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Thus honor the Lord with your substance; look upon all you have as
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:205549:96"/> your Masters Talents; for which, you must give an account: And so use and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them for God, that you may give up your account with joy; and then you will shew your selves thankful indeed. Thus you see what is included in real thankfulness. O, it is another matter than we take it to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next I promised to give you the Grounds and Reasons of this Duty. Why you are obliged after the receit of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to such a thankful return of praises. And among many, I will only single out these three, and briefly open them.</p>
            <p>First, God requires and expects it. It is so special and peculiar a part of his glory, as he will never part with it. As great Landlords oblige their Tenants to an homage and service, when they make over their Estates to them, and reserve a quit Rent to themselves, which they value at an high rate; so God when he bestows Deliverances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Mercies upon us, still reserves an acknowledgment to himself: And this is dear to him, he will not indure to be defrauded of it; much less, that it be given to another. You find this reservation of praise ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly made by him in <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.15. <hi>Call
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:205549:97"/> upon me in the day of trouble, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee, and thou shalt glorifie me<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Where you have the request, the grant and the reservation in the grant, <hi>q. d</hi> When I have granted thee thy desire, see thou do not defraud me of my glory There be three things in every Mercy the <hi>matter</hi> of it, the <hi>comfort</hi> of it, and the <hi>glory</hi> of it. The two first, God make<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> over freely to us, he gives the Mercie<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> themselves, he allows us to suck out al<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the lawful pleasure, and delight that is in them; but the third he reserves to himself, and will never part with to any other. If an <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himself render not to God due acknowledgments, as well as God loves him, there shall be great wrath upon him, and <hi>Judah,</hi> for the default. 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 32.26.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You are under manifold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements to render it to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Common ingenuity obliges to a due acknowledgment of favors freely received, and unthankfulness on tha<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> score, is the odium of mankind. <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum si dicas, omnia dixeris.</hi> You cannot give a man a more odious character a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, than to say, He is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful man.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:205549:97"/>(2.) The examples of the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then will condemn you. They praised their gods, which yet were no gods, when they received any deliverance. <hi>Judg.</hi> 16.24. Shall Idols, Dunghil-Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, receive their sacrifices and praises, whilest the true God is forgotten?</p>
            <p>Nay (3) many of you have formally and expresly obliged your Souls to it, by solemn vows and promises in the day of your distress: And yet will you deal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously with God? Will you not pay the vows which your lips have uttered? Certainly, you can never free your Souls from the guilt of perfidiousness against God, whilest you give him not the glory due to his name.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Lastly, Your ingratitude is the ready way to deprive you of the Mercies you have, and to withhold from you the Mercies you might have in your future distresses and wants. He that is ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for Mercies received, provokes God to remove them. Thus it fell out with ungrateful <hi>Israel. Hos.</hi> 2.5, 8, 9. <hi>She did not know, (i. e.)</hi> She did not with consideration and thanks duly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>edge) <hi>That I gave her Corn, and Wine, and Oyl. Therefore will I return, and take
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:205549:98"/> away my Corn in the time thereof; and my Wine in the season thereof: And will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover my Wool, and my Flax.</hi> Thus they suffered their Mercies to lapse into the Lords hand for non-payment of their Duties. If you be weary of your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and willing to be rid of them, you cannot take a more effectual course, than to forget from whom you had them, and withhold his praise for them.</p>
            <p>And then, for future Mercies and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, you have no ground to expect any more from God, whom you have thus requited for former favors. He that gives no thanks for one Mercy, hath lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground to expect another. It was a sad word which God spake upon this very provocation. <hi>Judg.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13. When a new distress befel <hi>Israel</hi> by the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and they cried to the Lord for help; he tells them, That he had many times delivered them from their enemies. <hi>Yet,</hi> saith he, <hi>have you forsaken me, and served other gods. Wherefore I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you no more; go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen, and let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. q. d.</hi> With what face can you come to me for new Merrcies and Deliverances, when
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:205549:98"/> your selves know, how former Mercies have been abused! Think ye that I am weary of my Mercies, to cast them away upon such unthankful wretches? No, no. Expect no more Mercies from me, <hi>I will deliver you no more.</hi> One of the Fathers calls ingratitude, <hi>Obex infernalis. An Hellish stop;</hi> which interrupts the course and current of all Gods Mercies. Mercy is not only a precious thing, too good to be cast away, but it is a very tender thing, and God deeply resents the abuses of it. Thus you see the Grounds and Reasons of your duty; it remains now that we apply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Ʋse.</hi> Is it your unquestionable Duty to return praises upon every receit of Mercies? Then in the first place, bear your shame and just reproof for your manifest unthankfulness. You dare not deny, but you have received many signal and eminent Mercies from the Hands of God. If you should deny that, I need go no farther to prove you prodigiously ungrateful. But it is too manifest to be denied: You have found God a very present help in trouble; his Mercy hath often rescued you out of the very jaws of death. Some of you have been in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:205549:99"/> dangers in the Deeps; in Deaths oft. You have been put to your wits end; all visible hope and help failed. You might have said with the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 142.4. <hi>I looked upon my right hand, and there was none; and upon the left, but refuge failed.</hi> You have seen your companions intombed before your eyes in the Seas, and concluded in your own thoughts, your turn was next. You have been in danger by barbarous enemies, that have chased you upon the Sea, to make you a prey: Yea, it may be you have been a prey to them, and never thought to have seen the Land of your Nativity; your Houses, Wives, and Children any more. You have languished under dangerous diseases, and that remote from friends, and necessary accommodations. You have lost your Estates, and been reduced to a low ebb, and never thought to have seen a day of prosperity any more. Yet hath the Lord delivered you out of all your troubles: He hath provided unexpected means of preservation, when the proud Waters were ready to go over your Souls. And though others went down before your eyes, you were marked out for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance. God spake to the raging
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:205549:99"/> Waves, saying, Touch not this Man▪ I will not deliver him up, though I have done so by others. When cruel enemies chased you, he delivered you, causing the darkness of the night to interpose seasonably betwixt you and them; as the dark side of the Cloud shadowed <hi>Israel</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> that pursued them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.20. Sometimes giving you a favorable gale, which blew Mercy and Deliverance to you: Sometimes by strengthning you to resist their furious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks, and delivering you from their rage; or, if he delivered you into their hands, yet there he preserved you, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling you to indure their severities, or causing the enemy to intreat you well; and finding out a way which you knew not, to bring you at last out of the House of Bondage.</p>
            <p>He pitied you under your dangerous diseases, and though necessary accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and means might be wanting he was your Physician, and healed you; he recovered you immediately without means, or blessed weak and small means to your good. When you were reduced by losses, and captivities to a low ebb. So that you might say as the Church,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:205549:100"/>
               <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.17. I forgat Prosperity. He hath not only recruited thy strength, but thy estate also; and when both thy body and estate, like an old leaky Ship, have been ready to sink; he hath stopped the leaks in both, careened, repaired, and launched thee into the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as whole, as sound, and strong as ever.</p>
            <p>And now Reader, suffer me to account and expostulate a little with thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. What hath the fruit of all these Mercies been to thee? And how hast thou carried it since those days, towards the God of thy Mercies. Hast thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been melted by the sense of all this kindness into love, thankfulness, and new obedience? Have these favors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged thee to more strictness in thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and greater watchfulness against sin? Hast thou said with that good man, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. And now, my God, seeing thou hast punished me less than mine iniquities deserve, and hast given me such Deliverances as these, should I again break thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? If it be so, surely Mercy and Goodness shall follow thee all the days of thy l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe. The Lord then reckons all
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:205549:100"/> these Mercies well bestowed, and will never repent that he hath done thee good.</p>
            <p>But I fear this is not thy case. Sure I am, there are some among you that have quickly forgotten the God that delivered you. Some that have abused him to his face, by ascribing his Mercies to good luck, chance, and fortune; not once owning him as your Deliverer. And some that have made his Mercies wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of sin, to wound him withal, wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your estates by prodigality, which were given to refresh your Families, and Gods poor; yea, abusing them to drunkenness and luxury: And is this the thanks you return him? For which of all my good Works (saith Christ to the <hi>Jews</hi>) do you stone me? So say I, for which of all Gods kindnesses to you, do you thus dishonor and abuse him? O let shame cover your faces this day. Go Reader, sold down this Leaf, and get thee to thy knees, and say, I am the man to whom this reproof is sent. I have abused the God of my Mercies, I have turned his Grace into wantonness Smite with <hi>Ephraim</hi> upon thy thigh, and say, <hi>What have I done!</hi> Mourn heartily
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:205549:101"/> for thy unkindness to thy best Friend, <hi>The God that hath done thee good all thy life long; and deserves other returns from thee than these.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Ʋse.</hi> Lastly, It calls upon you all to be thankful for your Mercies. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> once wished for a voice like Thunder, that all Men might hear him. O that I could so call you to this duty, that some of you might effectually hear Gods call in this Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Will you own the hand that delivers you, that feeds, cloaths, and heals you? Will you resolve to live the life of praise? And render to the Lord according to the benefits you have received? Will you indeed walk humbly and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, under all your Deliverances and Successes, and glorifie God by that, wherewith he hath comforted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed you? If there be any saving knowledge of God, and spiritual sense of his love in your Souls, methinks I should prevail with you; for do but weigh these following Arguments seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and they will ingage you to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Argument.</hi> How freely have all your Mercies streamed to you, from the Fountain of Grace! There was nothing
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:205549:101"/> in you to ingage it. The very notion of Mercy includes freeness; they are all bestowed upon us, not only as we are <hi>immerentes,</hi> but <hi>male merentes,</hi> unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving, but ill deserving Creatures; not only without our merits, but against our merits. And what though there be <gap reason="illegible: left margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> concurrence of your abilities, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, and hand-work, in the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of some of your Mercies, yet still those Mercies are the pure effects of Free-grace: For all those indeavors of yours had signified nothing to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement, without Gods Blessing; yea, and that wisdom and industry which you used, are themselves the Free-gifts of God. You know there be thousands in the World, as industrious and wise as you, and such as never provoked God by such sins as you have; who yet are denied the Mercies you injoy. O, how should this indear you to God!</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Argument.</hi> How seasonably your Mercies have been bestowed upon you, in the very nick of extremity and danger? God hath on purpose suffered it to grow to an extremity, that thereby he might commend his Mercy to you with the greater advantage. <hi>In the Mount of the

Are not some that went out with you, found wanting at your return? They are among the dead, it may be among the damned, and you among the living, yet injoying the capacity and means of Salvation. God hath prospered your Voyage, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with Success; you have sucked the abundance of the Sea, and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures hid in the Sand, as the Text speaks; but others may say as <hi>Naomi, Ruth</hi> 1.21.

            <p n="5">5 <hi>Argument.</hi> To conclude, if all the goodness of God, which hath passed before your eyes, do indeed prevail upon you, to love the Lord, and fear to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him; if they really constrain you to give up your selves, and all you have, to be his: Then all these, are but the beginnings of Mercies, and you shall see yet greater things than these. God hath more Mercies yet behind, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:205549:103"/> those of an higher kind, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature than these Temporal Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are. You are now delivered from the dangers of the Sea, and have escaped those perils: O but what is this, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from wrath to come? You have been preserved from, or delivered out of <hi>Turkish</hi> slavery. But what is that to a Deliverance from the curse of the Law, the bondage of your Lusts, and the power of Satan? Happy Souls, if these Deliverances prove introductive to the great Salvation.</p>

            <p>Thus I have (as the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me) indeavored to chuse, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove proper subjects for your Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in every condition that befals you. I cannot carry these Truths one degree farther; it is the Lord only, that can make them effectual to your Souls. But it is my earnest request to you Masters, that have the over-sight, and must give an account for your Companies, That you will not only read and consider these things your selves, but that you will at fit seasons, especially upon the Lords day, read and inculcate them upon your
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:205549:103"/> Servants and Company; and that, as those, who must give an account. Will not this be a better expence of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and hallowed time, than to spend it in sleeping in your Cabbins, or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Tipling-Houses? All that sin of theirs which you may prevent, and do not; becomes your own sin. And have you not personal sins enough already, but you must draw the guilt of their sins up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you also? I beseech you, and it is my last request, That you will faithfully labor, that you and your Companies may serve the Lord.</p>
